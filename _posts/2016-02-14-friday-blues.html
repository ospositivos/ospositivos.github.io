  <p>A última parte do <em>"<b>The TCJ 2015 Year-in-Review"</b></em> foi publicada hoje <a href="http://www.tcj.com/the-tcj-2015-year-in-review-spectacufuck-part-iv/" target="_blank"><sup>12 fev 2016</sup></a>. Começa assim:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rumors circulated in September that UK Prime Minister David Cameron had fucked a dead pig’s mouth while a student at Oxford.</p>
    <p>Cameron’s (alleged) pig-fucking had little-to-nothing to do with the comic industry, however, and so there’s no earthly reason whatsoever to mention David Cameron’s (alleged) hot, sweaty sexual intercourse with a dead pig.</p>
    <p>And yet, I can’t help but think that it’s worth noting in an article about comic books that David Cameron’s semi-erect penis might very well have glided firmly into a dead pig’s mouth, if for no other reason than because while (allegedly) face-fucking the dead pig, maybe David Cameron thought about Spider-Man’s porcine alter-ego Peter Porker, Spider-Ham. It’s possible!</p>
    <p>the implications to the comics industry of David Cameron rhythmically pounding his tiny curse into a deceased swine. After all, what would that say about all of us, you, me, that (alleged) pig-fucker David Cameron, all of us, that we all share Peter Porke,r Spider-Ham as a reference point — in Cameron’s (alleged) case, as a reference point for where to put his (alleged) penis?</p>
    <p>We should all give this a great deal of thought, except for the poor pig who’s been through enough (allegedly).<br>

  <p>Encontrámos um <i>kindred spirit</i> — esperamos estar à altura de servir igualmente bem os cómicos nacionais quando voltarmos com o <a href="{{ site.url }}/2015/08/critics-criticism.html"><b>Comics et al</b></a>, se o pudor não nos envergonhar —<em> hint: it wont!</em></p>
