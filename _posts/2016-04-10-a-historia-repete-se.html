        <p><b>The Next War</b></p>
        <p>The long war had ended.<br>
            Its miseries had grown faded.<br>
            Deaf men became difficult to talk to,<br>
            Heroes became bores.<br>
            Those alchemists<br>
            Who had converted blood into gold<br>
            Had grown elderly.<br>
            But they held a meeting,<br>
            Saying,<br>
            'We think perhaps we ought<br>
            To put up tombs<br>
            Or erect altars<br>
            To those brave lads<br>
            Who were so willingly burnt,<br>
            Or blinded,<br>
            Or maimed,<br>
            Who lost all likeness to a living thing,<br>
            Or were blown to bleeding patches of flesh<br>
            For our sakes.<br>
            It would look well.<br>
            Or we might even educate the children.'<br>
            But the richest of these wizards<br>
            Coughed gently;<br>
            And he said: </p>
        <p> 'I have always been to the front<br>
            -In private enterprise-,<br>
            I yield in public spirit<br>
            To no man.<br>
            I think yours is a very good idea<br>
            -A capital idea-<br>
            And not too costly . . .<br>
            But it seems to me<br>
            That the cause for which we fought<br>
            Is again endangered.<br>
            <b>What more fitting memorial for the fallen<br>
                Than that their children<br>
                Should fall for the same cause?'</b>
        </p>
        <p> Rushing eagerly into the street,<br>
            The kindly old gentlemen cried<br>
            To the young:<br>
            'Will you sacrifice<br>
            Through your lethargy<br>
            What your fathers died to gain ?<br>
            The world must be made safe for the young!'<br>
            And the children<br>
            Went. . . .</p>
