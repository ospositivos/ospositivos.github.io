  <blockquote><small> As an adult, I was extremely vain and had no ability to laught at myself. 
    I realize now that sometimes trying to suppress or eradicate something is more damning than just letting it be. You can't erase he past, and that goes doubly for someone who chooses to foist his work onto the public. I don't know that vanity can ever be truly overcome, but you can force yourself to laught at yourself, and you can try to be at least a little proud of what you've done. It's in that spirit that I present to you the contents of this box.</small></blockquote>
  <p>---what I keep deep inside my own box: <b>I Luv You.</b></p>
