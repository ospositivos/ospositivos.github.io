    <p><b>The war for the open internet is the defining issue of our time.</b> It&rsquo;s a scramble for control of the very fabric of human communication. And human communication is all that separates us from the utopia that thousands of generations of our ancestors slowly marched us toward — or the Orwellian, Huxleyan, Kafkaesque dystopia that a locked-down internet would make possible. </p>
    <p>The internet, it seems, is special. It&rsquo;s the ultimate information technology — capable of supplanting the telegram, telephone, radio, cinema, television, and much more — and there&rsquo;s no clear way to disrupt it. But the war for the commanding heights of the internet is far from over. There are many players on this global chess board. <b>Governments</b>. <b>Telecom</b> monopolies. Internet giants like <b>Google</b> and <b>Facebook</b>. NGOs. Startups. <b>Hackers</b>. And - most importantly - <b>you</b>. </p>
    <p><b>If you do nothing, we will lose the war for the open internet.</b> The greatest tool for communication and creativity in human history will fall into the hands of a few powerful corporations and governments. <br>

  <blockquote>
    <p>As much as we may think of the internet as a placeless realm of pure abstractions, it has a physical structure. It&rsquo;s not magic. And more people are waking up to this reality each day.</p>
    <p>The internet is a series of copper and fiber optic cables that burrow through the ground and tunnel under oceans. We call this the Internet Backbone. The internet is then further distributed through regional backbones. Despite the involvement of huge telecoms, the internet backbone represents a fairly healthy market. About 40% of the internet&rsquo;s backbone is controlled by smaller networks you&rsquo;ve never heard of. The broadband internet market, on the other hand, isn&rsquo;t healthy at all. This is the &quot;last mile&quot; of cables that plug into the internet backbone. And it&rsquo;s full of ugly tollbooths, guarded by thick benches of lawyers and lobbyists. </p>
    <p>These ISPs control millions of miles of copper cables that they buried in the ground and satellites they shot up into orbit. They constantly break the law, tie up regulators in lengthy court battles, and make it practically impossible for anyone — even Google — to enter their markets. </p>

    <blockquote> Apple App Store isn&rsquo;t a level playing field. It doesn&rsquo;t resemble the open internet it was built on top of. Instead, it&rsquo;s an example of a walled garden. Walled gardens look beautiful. They&rsquo;re home to the most popular flora. But make no mistake, you won&rsquo;t be able to venture very far in any one direction without encountering a wall. And every walled garden has a gatekeeper, who uproots plants that look like weeds. And Apple is one of the most aggressive gatekeepers of all.<br>

    <blockquote class="smallish">Internet.org is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries. It has been criticized for violating net neutrality, and by handpicking internet services that are included, for discriminating against companies not in the list, including Facebook's rivals.<br>

  <p>Voltando à <em>net neutrality: </em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The story of ISPs basically comes down to this:</p>
    <p>They used to make a ton of money off of cable packages. But people discovered that once they had the internet, they didn&rsquo;t care about cable TV any more — they just wanted data plans and so they could watch YouTube, Netflix, or whatever shows they wanted.</p>
    <p>The ISPs don&rsquo;t make nearly as much selling you a data plan as they used to make selling you a cable plan, though. So their goal is to return to the &quot;good old days&quot; by locking down the internet into &quot;channels&quot; and &quot;bundles&quot; then forcing you to buy those.</p>
    <p>How do we prevent this? The good news is that we already have. In 2015, the FCC passed a law that regulated ISPs as utilities. This is based on the principle of &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; which basically states that all information passing through a network should be treated equally.
      The FCC&rsquo;s Title II regulation created three &quot;bright lines&quot; that prevent ISPs from doing the following: </p>
    <p>1. Blocking content from websites;<br>
      2. Slowing down content from websites;<br>
      3. Accepting money from websites to speed up their content;</p>
    <p>These rules made it so that no matter how rich and powerful a corporation is — and Apple and Google are the biggest corporations on Earth, and Microsoft and Facebook aren&rsquo;t far behind — they can&rsquo;t buy priority access to the internet. </p>
    <p>Everyone has to compete on a level playing field. These tech conglomerates have to compete with the scrappy startups, the mom-and-pop businesses, and even independent bloggers who are running WordPress on their own domain.
      It&rsquo;s as simple a tool as possible for protecting the capitalist free market internet from monopolies who would otherwise abuse their power.</p>
    <p>The reason ISPs want to get rid of Net Neutrality is simple: if we stop treating them like the utility that they are, they can find ways to charge a lot more money.
      ISPs see an opportunity to double dip. They want to charge for bandwidth, and also charge websites what the Mafia calls &quot;protection money.&quot; They essentially want to be able to say to website owners: &quot;Those are some lovely data packets you&rsquo;ve got there. It sure would be a shame if they got lost on their way to your users.&quot;<br>

  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Without traffic, the open web dies.</div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The ISPs wouldn&rsquo;t need to block these websites. All the ISPs would need to do is introduce a slight latency.</p>
    <p>Both Google and Microsoft have done research that shows that if you slow down a website by even 250 milliseconds — about how long it takes to blink your eyes — most people will abandon that website.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s right — speed isn&rsquo;t a feature, it&rsquo;s a basic prerequisite for attracting an audience. If an ISP artificially slows down a website, it&rsquo;s practically as damaging as blocking the site entirely. Both of these acts result in the same outcome — a severe loss of traffic. <br>

    <p>Facebook and Google have long pushed in this general direction, because it&rsquo;s the only way they can continue to rapidly expand their already massive online empires. When they outgrew the computers and other data center hardware that served up their services, they built their own. Once they saturated online markets in the developed world, they started building high-altitude balloons, drones, and wireless antennas to make the internet accessible in entirely new locations. And as they pushed more and more data across the globe, they started investing in their own intercontinental cables. </p>
