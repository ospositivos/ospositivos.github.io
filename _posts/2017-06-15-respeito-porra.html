  <p>Webcomics e das coincidências: acabadinhos de <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/06/one-of-those-things.html">rever</a> um período histórico destes, e sai o anúncio que a <b>Library of Congress</b> dos américas vai começar a arquivar estes. <em>Damn!</em></p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> the Library of Congress has discovered webcomics and is going big </div>
  <blockquote> The library will announce Tuesday that <b>the Webcomics Web Archive is officially launching at loc.gov as part of its growth in &quot;born-digital&quot; collections</b>. The first phase of the webcomics online collection will include nearly 40 titles, including such long-running works as <b>Josh Lesnick’s &quot;Girly&quot;</b> and <b>Zach Weiner’s &quot;Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal.&quot;</b><br>

  <p>Da seleção feita no arranque do arquivo:</p>
  <blockquote> The webcomics archive includes a focus on diversity in terms of both cartoonists and characters <span class="voice">[and]</span> also political content, including<b> Matt Bors’s &quot;The Nib&quot;</b> archive, as well as comics representing diverse narratives on human sexuality, including <b>Erika Moen’s &quot;DAR&quot;</b> and <b>Jess Fink’s &quot;Chester 5000 XYV.&quot;</b> The longevity and acclaim of the webcomics are also criteria in culling the initial archive.<br>

  <p>- mas como escrevem no <b>Fleen</b> a propósito da notícia:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>It’s a hell of a job of curation, too.</b> A lot of the listed comics are award winners or nominees (Eisners, NCS, etc); some are no-brainers, like the Library of Congress including the library-themed Unshelved, and the importance of politcal cartooning makes The Nib a shoo-in. But how to explain the presence of As The Crow Flies, Chester 5000, or DAR!, except that<b> somebody over at The LOC really pays attention to work in a wide variety of genres and story styles</b>, over the past decade, from creators of all backgrounds?<br>

  <p>Palavra ao <em>about</em> oficial da coleção: <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/webcomics-web-archive/" target="_blank"><b>Webcomics Web Archive</b></a></p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p>This collection focuses on comics created specifically for the web and supplements the Library of Congress’ extensive holdings in both comic books, graphic novels, and original comic art. </p>
      <p> Webcomics are an increasingly popular format utilized by contemporary creators in the field and often includes material by artists not available elsewhere. Webcomics selected for this collection include award-winning comics (Eisner Awards, Harvey Awards, Eagle Awards, and Shuster Awards) as well as webcomics that have significance in the field due to longevity, reputation, and subject matter.</p>
      <p> This collection includes work by artists and subjects not traditionally represented in mainstream comics, including women artists and characters, artists and characters of color, LGBTQ+ artists and characters, as well as subjects such as politics, health and human sexuality, and autobiography.</p>
      <p> The content of these websites is captured as it was originally produced and may include content that is not suitable for all ages.<br>

  <p>E seguem-se os nossos <em> told-u-sos</em>. Três apenas, não queremos estar a maçar-vos demasiado no tópico — aquela coisa d<b>OS POSITIVOS</b> terem sempre <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/06/phony.html">razão</a> já mais que deve ter feito mossa por esta  altura. <i>First, all things digital:</i></p>
  <blockquote> The library also announced the launch of its <b>Web Cultures Web Archive</b>, &quot;a representative sampling of<b> websites documenting the creation of emergent cultural traditions on the web</b> such as GIFs, memes and emoji&quot;.<br>

  <p><em>Artsy-farsty </em>no papel: já nem tem piada bater no ceguinho. Segundo, <em>arsty-fartsy </em>no <b>Facebook</b> a contar para o digital? <em>Nigga please,</em> depois de tudo o que já dizemos <a href="{{ site.url }}/2016/12/alt-zinesters-doing-it-to-themselves.html">antes</a>? A Library do Congresso está a arquivar os webcomics com uma <em>&quot;Wayback Machine-like archive&quot;</em>: adivinha lá o que resta aos teus posts nesta? Nada. Zero. <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/03/digital-over-lasting.html">Nunca exististes</a>. Não nos entendas mal: o estar fora do radar tem o seu mérito, mas apenas quando essa parte da intenção — não um acidente e muito menos quando te esforças no inverso como <em>— uh, I dunno — </em> grosso modo é o caso de quem posta no FB. Terceiro e último: boa sorte em encontrar algo parecido à realidade nacional, seja no acto de arquivar, seja no objecto. Voltando e terminando com citações da nossa entrada anterior, a repensar à luz das novidades: <i>&quot;websites don’t last forever, after all / Webcomics don’t even need websites anymore.&quot;</i> Pois.</p>
