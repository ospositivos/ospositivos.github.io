  <p>E às vezes, a confirmação que não estamos sozinhos nisto. Cartoons, comics, web, <i>for tha fun,</i> <b>$$$</b>, jornais, até o <i>graphic design</i> é chamado à mistura.</p>
  <p>A vossa atenção para <b>Caleb Orecchio</b> in <i>"11/13/2017"</i> <a href="http://comicsworkbook.com/111317-2/" target="_blank"><sup>13 nov 2017</sup></a> sff:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As the holidays approach, I’m thinking about how I’m going to lie to my family. I don’t talk about my comics in a serious way around them anymore. I just do them for fun, I tell them. That’s great! they say back. Once I told an extended family member that I visited a comics syndicate in New York and showed them my comic strip. WOW — New York, that must’ve been exciting! Very much so. Did they except your strip? No — they said it was &quot;too good&quot; - like, it wasn’t simple enough — it’d be hard to sell to newspaper editors. The family member didn’t know what to say after that. That’s okay though, I tell them. I still make a comic strip every week day for a comics website. Oh cool — do they pay you? No. Again, they are speechless. Then I get defensive like I have to protect my dignity or something because I assume <b>they think I’m an idiot who doodles all day for no money. I just do comics for fun really</b>, I tell them - I’m actually a freelance graphic designer. That’s great — how’s business, they ask? Great. I switch the subject to how good the food is. The guy who does my taxes has a similar reaction to my comics making. He keeps telling me I should focus on my graphic design and try to expand. &quot;Is there any money in comics?&quot; he asks. &quot;There is at the newspaper syndicates — I’m going to keep trying until I get in.&quot; <b>&quot;Who reads newspapers?&quot;</b><br>

  <p>Quem os lê, <i>indeed</i>. Ou se calhar estamos mesmo sozinhos nisto. Não seria a <a href="{{ site.url }}/2015/05/home-alone.html">primeira</a> vez, <a href="{{ site.url }}/2015/07/porque.html">não</a> será a última.</p>
