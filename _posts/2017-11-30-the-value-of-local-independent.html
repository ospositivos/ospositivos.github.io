    <p>De estratégias sustentáveis a propósito de <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/11/de-dogmas-praticos-e-praticas-dogmaticas.html">festivais de BD</a> — parte um. Permitam-nos um exemplo — mas temos que dar a volta maior.</p>
    <p>Sobrevivendo ao Apocalipse da <b>Amazon</b> <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/06/amazing.html"><em>on the rise</em></a><em>, &quot;a funny thing happened&quot;: &quot;indie bookstores staged an unexpected comeback&quot;.</em> E nesse tópico o registo de um estudo noticiado originalmente na revista da <b>Harvard Business School</b> <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-independent-bookstores-haved-thrived-in-spite-of-amazon-com" target="_blank"><sup>20 nov 2017</sup></a> <sup class="asterisk">(*)</sup> <span class="sidenote sidenote-right">Mas <em>worry not</em>, chega-nos via <b>Quartz</b><a href="https://qz.com/1135474/how-independent-bookstores-thrived-in-spite-of-amazon/" target="_blank"><sup> 26 nov 2017</sup></a> por terceiros. <i><a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/11/o-monstro-cibernetico-e-grande.html">We-good</a>.</i> Importou-nos destacar a sua área de estudo: o <em>comportamento</em> organizacional. Não é uma escolha inocente.</span> sobre identidade, comunidade, <em>indies</em>, tecnologia, e livros. O autor, <em>&quot;assistant professor in the Organizational Behavior unit&quot;, &quot;studies how mature organizations and industries faced with technological change reinvent themselves&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;even attended a training course on how to open an independent bookstore&quot;</em> e <em>&quot;began with his study of the Swiss watch industry, which collectively reinvented itself (and thus survived) in the wake of digital watches.&quot;</em></p>

    <p> Do registo do tempo ao registo do pensamento, novamente o digital. Deste e do papel, e agora socorremos-mos do seu <em>abstract</em>.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p> Overall, this work aims to contribute to extant theory at <b>the intersection of research on technological change, social movements, and collective identity</b>. Together, these contributions provoke new avenues to think about how incumbents <b>preserve legacy technologies and business models</b> in established fields <b>when faced with technological change</b>. </p>
        <p> Because independent bookstores are, by definition, independent, this setting offers a unique context to explore this paper&rsquo;s research question<b>: &quot;How do independent actors in a mature industry collectively respond to a technological discontinuity?&quot;</b><br>

    <p><b>Identidades</b>, portanto. Seguem-se as <b>narrativas</b> oficiais —</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p> In the wake o f a technological discontinuity, <b>the pervading view is that incumbents will eventually abandon the displaced legacy technology</b> in favor of the new variant, or fall victim to competitors who are able to adopt the capabilities associated with the new dominant design.<br>

    <p>— e como o estudo as quer contrariar.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul class="lista">
            <li>First, prior research on social movements and organizational responses to technological change has largely examined how and why incumbent firms eventually adopt practices or values that <b>emerge from an outside</b> social movement. Here, I examine an instance where the locus of the social movement <b>originates from within</b> the incumbent field as a response to a new technological order. </li>
            <li>Second, scholars interested in incumbent responses to technological change have highlighted how <b>collective identity can become a cognitive trap</b> that can prevent; here again, this paper offers an alternative view that illustrates how collective identity can become a mechanism to <b>enable incumbent resilience and adaptation</b> in the wake of a technological discontinuity. </li>
            <li>Finally, research at the intersection of social movements and collective identity has examined how mobilization of normative and economic interests can constitute <b>new market</b> categories with <b>distinct collective identities</b>. This paper, however, examines how social movements and <b>collective identity</b> mobilization can reshape a <b>mature market</b> category. </li>

            <b>The &quot;3 C&rsquo;s&quot; of independent bookselling&rsquo;s resurgence:</b>
            <ul class="lista">
                <li><b>Community:</b> Independent booksellers were some of the first to champion the idea of localism; bookstore owners across the nation promoted the idea of consumers supporting their local communities by shopping at neighborhood businesses.</li>
                <li><b>Curation</b>: Independent booksellers began to focus on curating inventory that allowed them to provide a more personal and specialized customer experience. Rather than only recommending bestsellers, they developed personal relationships with customers by helping them discover up-and-coming authors and unexpected titles.</li>
                <li><b>Convening:</b> Independent booksellers also started to promote their stores as intellectual centers for convening customers with likeminded interests—offering lectures, book signings, game nights, children&rsquo;s story times... even birthday parties.</li>

    <p> Mercado, elites, gigantes prepotentes e freaks locais. Mas reparamos: o crédito reparte-se por uma mistura de estratégias do <em>down-up</em>, as que nos ocuparam até aqui, e <i>top-down:</i></p>
    <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> ABA promoted and codified a collective identity that established category cohesiveness but simultaneously preserved local store independence when coupled with bottom-up efforts from store owners</div>
    <blockquote>
        <p>While all this was happening on a local level, there was important top-down work going on at the American Booksellers Association. The <b>ABA</b> served as a glue to bind likeminded players together — facilitating partnerships between bookstores and other local businesses, for example. The ABA also strengthened the collective identity of indie bookstores by helping its members share best practices, such as how to use social media to promote special events.<br>

    <p> Todos felizes portanto: há de tudo um pouco para neoliberais e apologistas do poder central e local não se chatearam.</p>
    <p>E se falharam em compreender o exemplo dado, recuperamos este vídeo do <b><em> The Lakes International Comic Art Festival</em></b> — um festival de BD na sua 5ª edição. Chamamos a vossa atenção à integração deste com as livrarias (e outros estabelecimentos) locais, minuto 1:33 <i>and counting:</i> fica a sugestão aos que organizam festivais.</p>
