  <p>No tópico de apropriação cultural no <b>TCJ</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Out of more than 77,000 works in MoMA's permanent collection, not one of them is by Mike Sekowsky. One hundred forty-six are by Lichtenstein. What is it that Lichtenstein does that's so superior? Let's pretend it isn't about money.</p>
    <p>Museums prestige rests, in some part, on a perceived notion that they possess some sort of intelligence that the world at large can access within their halls. If so, why can they only process this kind of imagery when it's really, really big and has a history of being exchanged for lots of money. A well-made image, blown up to gargantuan size, seems to be how the art world can process (if we're being charitable) or use (if we're being fair) cartooning.</p>
 <p>Let's make no mistake though: cartooning, artistically speaking, is doing fine without the validation of museums or influential art writers.</p>
