  <blockquote>The authority of the humor and the uniqueness of how these comics were laid out indicated that the artists didn’t just ‘believe’ in what they were doing; when reading them, their approach suggested itself as the only logical path. The work was so fun to read that it melted other approaches away, at least while the comic was in front of your eyes. <b>Having something so strong given away as free didn’t come across as humble, but instead</b> <strong>as an attack on everything else.</strong><br>
