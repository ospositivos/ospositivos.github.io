      <p>Aspects of this vision are likely to raise concerns in parts of the comics business that don&rsquo;t welcome disruption and, nearly a decade on, still barely tolerate the concept of digital comics, much less the looming presence of Amazon in publishing and retail. With today&rsquo;s announcement, some publishers might be feeling hot breath on their necks as Amazon further closes the gap between creators and their audience, blurring the lines between being an agnostic distribution platform and a direct competitor to imprints specializing in creator-owned content.<br>

  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Handing them that further grasp on not just the comic book market and not just the book publishing market but really the entire retail fabric of America.  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Traditionally, the conventional wisdom about where print-on-demand had the most potential for publishers was in the backlist, with titles that were out of print and weren&rsquo;t really hot enough to justify a proper reprint edition. There&rsquo;s really not much money up front. It&rsquo;s easy money potentially, but someone still has to get the files together and deal with the metadata, so in the absence of not selling many copies and it looking pretty shitty, it&rsquo;s never been anything that we&rsquo;ve been too enthusiastic about.</p>
    <p>What I see Amazon doing with their print-on-demand is a little bit different. <span class="voice">[They]</span> get publishers to sign on to use Amazon&rsquo;s print-on-demand service and agree to basically be one of these fast track publishers where for that time that we&rsquo;re out of stock and before we finish another printing, they will fulfill demand on their end, via their own POD system. And in doing so they can, quote unquote, guarantee your book will always be in stock and shipping within 24 hours. <b>I find that slightly, ever so slightly, nefarious, because at that point then they really have become not just the distributor or the retailer but also the manufacturer and publisher. More to the point, they&rsquo;re further conditioning consumers to not only buy from Amazon, but to buy from Amazon because they know that Amazon is more likely to have it than anybody else, in this case because they&rsquo;re literally manufacturing it themselves.</b><br>

  <p>No rescaldo da controvérsia  nota-se a relação complicada dos<em> comics</em> ao <b>$$$</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Comics’ commodity form feels broken. </b> When publishers big or small say, &quot;buy our books or we won&rsquo;t be able to exist&quot;, there&rsquo;s a problem. It&rsquo;s not on them, but it leads me to believe that our paradigm for publishing is broken. To be clear, I see a huge issue, when the responsibility of the &quot;success&quot; of works implicitly falls on the shoulders of the consumer.</p>
    <p><span class="voice">[Enquanto]</span> the form is flourishing en masse, the distribution method is failing us collectively. This intersects with failures of capitalism and culture, of course – in other spheres you can separate them a good bit, <b>but comics, being born as a commodity form wind up inextricably connected to the market</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>E fecham-se ideias em variante próxima do POD e <em>self-publishing</em> aos necessitados do <b>$$$</b>, <em>crowdfunding:</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Just thinking out loud here about the larger issue of how comics wind up &quot;locked up&quot; in their own cultural space. </b></p>
    <p>Some extremely smart and creative people have figured out how to use this system to make their comics flourish in the market. Though they succeed in existing in a market, what often times happens is, the campaigns fail to integrate the work into existing ecosystems of libraries, stores and schools in a way that traditional publishers are able to engage with.</p>
    <p><b>When comics can be reproduced and shared,</b> like music, by being saved to hard drives, by being clipped onto the fridge, by being shared with friends by loaning our copy of a book or pointing a friend to the library, <b>we harness comics&rsquo; ability to &quot;float&quot; as cultural experiences.</b> To connect us to each other, and to new knowledge. When this happens, comics occupy a role that becomes personal, independent of our relations to what&rsquo;s going on in the comics market, a space that will likely never be hospitable to new ideas.</p>
