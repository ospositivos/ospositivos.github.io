<div class="coluna">
  <p>Parte <a href="{{ site.url }}/2018/09/human-comics-interaction.html">3 de 3</a> do estado da arte, <i>zee-geist</i> entre <sup>24 a 26 set 2018</sup>: BD, passado, presente e futuro, <i>et media</i>. Os <em>comix</em> como bastardos dos media estão-nos no génese das intenções, tratemos do macro: hoje, esses últimos — dependendo das prioridades, os primeiros — os <em>últimos dez anos</em>, e os <em>outros tantos</em> <em>por vir</em>. O papel, o digital, e o <b>$$$</b>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The story of the last decade-plus hasn&rsquo;t been about mass closures — it&rsquo;s been about mass shrinkage. The pace at which newspapers are shutting down isn&rsquo;t much different from what it was in the late 20th century. Instead, just about every daily paper has gotten smaller — year after year after year. <b>It&rsquo;s death by a thousand paper cuts.</b> Even the most pro-print publishers will tell you that, someday, the &ldquo;cost of print&rdquo; and &ldquo;revenue from print&rdquo; lines will intersect on an accountant&rsquo;s projection and it&rsquo;ll be time to stop the presses for good. The only question is when. </p>
    <p>So one of the questions I&rsquo;m most interested in for the near- to medium-term future is what will actually happen when print newspapers start to disappear in large numbers: will those print readers just become digital readers? <br>

  <p>Resposta <em>so far: </em>não.</p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> In print, newspapers had few if any competitors. Online, they have infinite competitors. </div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>New research offers some insight into those questions. And the news is generally not that great. Shutting down print doesn&rsquo;t drive those readers to print-like consumption habits on digital devices. Instead, they become a lot like other digital readers — easily distracted, flitting from link to link, and a little allergic to depth. <br>

  <p>Caso do <em>Independent</em> que em <em>went online-only</em> em 2016: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="voice">[The]</span> few print readers were responsible for about 81 percent of all time spent consuming Independent content <span class="voice">[e]</span> all its digital platforms made up only 19 percent - <span class="voice">[e!]</span> <strong>all the Independent print readers spent just… disappeared when the paper did.</strong> It didn&rsquo;t transition to independent.co.uk. The demand went elsewhere — whether to another news site, a few minutes of Facebook scrolling, Netflix, Fortnite, an afternoon nap, or whatever else caught someone&rsquo;s attention. <br>

  <p>Qualquer outra coisa que lhes tome a atenção? O nosso <em> call </em>aos<em> comix, ya punx (losers). </em>Perguntamos quem respondeu à chamada...? </p>
  <p>Porque importa preencher esse vazio, perguntam-nos de volta? Putas... perguntam-nos mesmo isso? Na era da comunicação global a preços zero e <em>gatekeepers</em> porta fora?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Leaving print is the ultimate cost-cutting; a huge share of a newspaper&rsquo;s cost structure is tied up in building-sized printing presses and Canadian forests and ink by the barrel. But when that day comes — even if it helps a newspaper&rsquo;s bottom line — its audience isn&rsquo;t likely to follow along. <b>And that means accepting a dramatic decline in reach, influence, and impact.</b> <br>

  <p>Porque acabar com os <em>gatekeepers</em> sempre foi chave, e vocês cospem assim numa luta de séculos porque a oportunidade vos cai no colo como dada? <em>U get no respect from us: </em>vazio? Okupa.</p>
