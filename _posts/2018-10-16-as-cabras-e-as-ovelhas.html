  <p>Neste espaço tentamos recuperar quando possível a relação  imprensa / banda desenhada como simbiose privilegiada em comunicação de massas,  uma ligação há muito perdida e renegada para os livros de história, e dos quais  gradualmente desaparece com a distância que separa prática e causa. Nesse  tópico, entrevista a <b>Eddie Campbell</b> a propósito do<em><b> &quot;The Goat Getters: Jack  Johnson, the Fight of the Century, and How a Bunch of Raucous Cartoonists  Reinvented Comics&quot;</b></em> <sup>2018</sup> por <b>Mark Newgarden</b>, um dos autores daquele outro  livro que também não podemos deixar de recomendar, <em><b>&quot;How To Read  Nancy&quot;</b></em> <sup>2017</sup>. </p>
  <p><em>Long story  short,</em> entrevista no <b>TCJ</b>:</p>

    <p><b>Here&rsquo;s  the poop: The Goat Getters covers more fresh bases in comics history.</b><br>
      <br>
      It&rsquo;s a book about so many intersecting things,  as the 19th century gave way to the 20th: <b>cartooning, storytelling, newspaper  culture and design, it&rsquo;s a sort of untold history of the comic strip from a  vantage point that previous chroniclers often miss</b>, as the Sunday color  supplements and daily comic strips became isolated from the rest of the  newspaper.<br>

  <p>Teses:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> I've developed my own concept of the history of  cartooning, of which &quot;comics&quot; is just one aspect. I tend to groan  when all those &quot;History of Comics&quot; come out and as time has moved  along they have got narrower in their focus. In which more often than not the  writer is reiterating the conventional old narrative of the previous one. Also,  when some of these histories get to joining up the dots, they are seeing only  the dots in a narrow window and thus missing the real connections that are  invisible to them. So <b>there was a  pressing need to see the old comics and cartoons in their context, to see the  newspaper as a holistic environment in which cartoonists could be moving this  way and that and working in several sections of the paper at the same time and  not just the comics pages</b>. If you go at it all without the usual prejudices,  a quite different story can be drawn out.<small>in <a href="http://www.tcj.com/getting-the-goat-getters-a-conversation-with-eddie-campbell/" target="_blank"><em>&quot;Getting the Goat Getters: A Conversation with Eddie Campbell&quot;</em></a> <sup>9 out  2018</sup></small></p>

    <p>Uma para a academia, e simplicidade de proposições:</p>

      <p>      Unlike academic texts,<b> with me it's all  directed toward telling a story</b>. For example, nobody has written about this  stuff before so I had to invent all the terminology. With the  strip-under-the-strip effect that Herriman used and several other artists  borrowed, I found myself calling it &quot;the lower quadrant.&quot; Away with  that, I thought, crossing it out, and wrote &quot;the basement.&quot;<br>

    <p>It was an irregular combination of the serious  and the funny in the same layout that has no comparison in any other graphic  medium as far as I know. The trick was to praise the guy and get his goat at  the same time.<br>
