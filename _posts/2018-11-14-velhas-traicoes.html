<h2 class="subtitle">e novas tradições</h2>
<div class="coluna">
  <p>A fechar a trilogia em tradições-contradições-traições,  sentimo-nos na necessidade de recuperar comparações em punx-música-bd. A  relação destes é-nos uma tradição antiga, da qual o <a href="{{ site.url }}/2018/11/velhas-contra-licoes.html"><em>diss</em> ao <em>normies</em></a> é  apenas uma parte. Substituam anarquismo/punk como  sinónimo de música e no seu lugar pensem <em>comix</em>: sintam as semelhanças.</p>

  <p>    Folk punk  was an accessible, cheap, self-consciously unrefined format. 
    It&rsquo;s also  possible that anarchist values took root in the punk scene precisely because they  were so marginalized elsewhere.<br>

<p> Essa marginalidade uma quase-constante da história da BD, a acessibilidade parte fundamental do seu apelo e razão do seu uso como <em>&quot;propaganda&quot;</em>. <em>Weaponized comix</em>: já o <a href="{{ site.url }}/2015/08/weaponize-comics.html">dissemos  antes</a>.</p>

  <p>One could  also argue that music that pushes aesthetic and cultural boundaries can open up  listeners to a wider spectrum of possibility in other spheres of life as well.<br>

<p>Processo que apenas funcionará por apropriação - e se nos acompanham neste espaço não vos damos  novidade alguma - já que a BD rende-se ao <b>$$$</b>, inócua, só para os putos <sup>(*)</sup>, <em>bubllegum</em> mastiga e deita fora.</p>
<p><small>*) Em escalas de idade mental.</small></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An  anarchist milieu characterized by consumerism rather than initiative, a focus  on identity rather than dynamic change, activities limited to the leisure time  of the participants, ideological conflicts that boil down to disputes over  taste, and an orientation towards youth that made the movement largely  irrelevant upon the onset of adulthood: is no longer possible to depend on the  punk subculture as an incubator for anarchists.<br>

<p>Na sua génese, a bd deve a existência a triangulação de  tecnologia, indústria e mercado - como o punk. Este rebela-se, mas apenas foi possível quando as condições materiais e sociais o permitiram: um paradoxo, aqui revisto:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The meaning  people find in it is real enough, but it is generated through forces largely  beyond their control.<br>

<p>O punk, música e  bd,
      <em>&quot;came to  be cultivated by capitalists&quot;</em>, mas em abono da última  a sua <em>corrupção</em> é um percurso em sentido contrário onde cada vitória, por mínima que seja, será sempre uma conquista. A música é domada pela indústria porque lhe é anterior, mas os <em>comics</em> devem-lhe a existência,  qualquer manifestação que lhe gore intenções um progresso. </p>
<p>Mas esta não é a traição que nos acode.</p>
<p>Esta é.<em>Make punk, not... politics?!</em> Ou, aquilo da substituição  de termos:<em> &quot;make comics, not politics&quot;</em>. <em>Underground</em> ou alternativo  com alguma verve? Anos idos, a fechar na década de 90 na melhor das hipóteses.</p>
<div class="info coluna">
  <p><small>Remember 1999? Quando os <b>P+</b> entraram em hibernação.</small></p></div>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Punk - at  least for that generation - had reached the end of its trajectory as a force  for social change: a rupture had developed between the aesthetic and political  elements in the subculture.</b></p>
  <p>Until 1999,  politicized punks tended to stick around the DIY underground, as there was  usually no larger revolutionary milieu to move on to; playing music and writing  zines were seen as political activity, despite the narrow horizons of the  subculture. All that changed after the 1999 WTO protests, which kicked off an  era of non-stop demonstrations and political organizing. <b>Most of the people who  were serious about their politics shifted focus away from the punk scene.  Meanwhile, the people who were involved in punk only for music and fashion  remained, and led a reaction against political engagement of all kinds.</b> While  others focused on anarchist convergences, black blocs, and accountability  processes, the reactionaries were the ones still booking shows and recording  albums, and they set the tone for an apolitical and musically conservative 21st  century punk scene.<br>

<p>Aqueles que estão hoje na BD parecem defender maneirismos acima de mensagens, e assim chegados ao presente: <strong>&quot;Tecnologia,  Legitimidade&quot;</strong>. A nossa guerra pelos <em>webcomics,</em> formato ainda desdenhado  porque demasiado inovador para os <a href="{{ site.url }}/2016/10/punk-gone-digital.html">cómicos do formol</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There had  always been a tension in punk between the folk art aspects of the  craft - three-chord musical progressions and hand-drawn layouts - and the desire to  innovate and challenge. This experimentation contributed to the fragmentation  of the punk subculture, as traditions were abandoned.<br>

<p><em>Tech.</em> Em digital.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One could  read the rise and fall of DIY punk as the historical &ldquo;hiccup&rdquo; during which  record-releasing and printing technology first became accessible to the general  public. (...) Within a couple decades, however, this development was rendered  moot by technological advances and oversaturation. Once anyone could release a  record, it wasn&rsquo;t meaningful anymore — it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;real&rdquo; in the sense that  everything on television is &ldquo;real&rdquo; while our lives feel unreal and  insignificant.<br>

<p>...<em>versus</em> materialistas agarrados do papel e livro impresso para  validação.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>This  indicates a lingering materialism in DIY culture. </b>Equipment conferred the  legitimacy that both performers and audiences longed for. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; working class  dropouts could say to themselves, gesturing at a rusty van full of gear that  cost them years of wages, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re a real band!&rdquo;<br>

<p><em>Webcomics,</em> a revolução...</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The punk  scene had been founded on the tensions created by limited access to the musical  means of production; with the arrival of technologies that extended this access  to everyone, its structures collapsed. The internet replaced painstakingly  built distribution networks and zine cultures with the offhand immediacy of  music downloading and blogs; some of this took place in genuinely decentralized  structures, but more of it was based in corporate counterfeits.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>...e o nosso desencanto com a BD em geral:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Once the  internet made every band into its own promotions agency and youtube.com made it  possible for everyone to appear on the equivalent of MTV, independent music was  no less mediated than corporate music, and no less vapid. (...) The ensuing  disenchantment revealed how banal the promise of rock stardom had been in the  first place [and] this only drains the world of meaning even further—and pure  nihilism helps maintain the status quo.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>E aqui terminamos equiparações do punk-música ao punk-BD:  as novas <em>tech</em> podem/devem ser apropriadas, trazem com elas a possibilidade de uma  nova (tradição em) proximidade, e essa é fundamental. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Punk  offered a relatively unmediated experience: one could meet one&rsquo;s favorite  musicians, dance and interact outside the prescriptions of a repressive  society, even form one&rsquo;s own band and remake the subculture itself. <br>

<p>O reaproximar de <em>freaks, </em> poucos e  demasiado espalhados entre si, criam comunidades. Essas, BD, punx, <b>OS POSITIVOS</b>: fanzine do contra a pregar aos <em>teens</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> A  sustainable space that nurtures long-term communities of resistance can  ultimately contribute more to militant struggle than the sort of impatient  insurrectionism that starts with confrontation rather than building to it. All  the better if it is a politically diverse space in which debate and dynamic  change can occur and new people can encounter radical ideas.</p>
  <p>Social  movements should be subversive while not immediately provoking repression - it&rsquo;s  important that the lines be drawn, but participants must have enough time to go  through an evolutionary process before the police break out their batons.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> <b>This is how  punk can inspire us: as a transformative outlet for rage and grief and joy, a  <del>positive</del> model for togetherness and self-determination in our social relations,  an example of how the destructive urge can also be creative—and vice versa.</b><br>
