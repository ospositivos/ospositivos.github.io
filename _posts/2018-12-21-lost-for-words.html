  <blockquote>
    It had become impossible to combine domesticity and creative work. I could not adjust myself to the routine of domesticity. There was a feeling always that I was shut in — that I didn’t belong to myself. I missed my old solitude, the easy-going way of having my meals any time I wanted to, of going to bed at any hour and getting up when I liked. Day after day this kind of living annoyed me. Why must I stop for lunch at twelve o’clock if I happened to be right in the swing of an absorbing cartoon? To be courteous? Which comes first — I kept asking myself — dutiful domesticity or draftsmanship and dreams? These things continually irked me, and left scars, and I was envious of artists who could ‘let go’ when their emotions got pent up, who could raise hell if interrupted at their work by foolish questions. I began day-dreaming about open roads and fields—the soil, rippling streams, and the sunshine as I knew them in boyhood. If only I could go barefoot again, wade in a creek and feel the cool touch of plowed ground. If only I could let the warm sun soothe the back of my neck while I stood with naked feet on a grassy knoll. I would be well again mentally as well as physically. The fact that the bars which formed my cage were invisible made them no less real. I realized that something had happened inside of me when I married that had crippled me — <b>nothing, of course, that one could describe in words</b>. <br>
