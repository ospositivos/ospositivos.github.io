  <p><a href="{{ site.url }}/2018/12/pos-institucional.html">Ficámos</a> da <em>&quot;<b>disintermediation</b> process characteristic of the social internet&quot;. </em>Porque <em>não devemos </em> terminar mediadores, em quatro passos:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul class="lista">
      <li>The end-to-end connection principle establishe<span class="voice">[s]</span> a reality often oblivious to facts. </li>
      <li>In this new ecosystem, political actors present the scenarios that interest them most. </li>
      <li>On the other end, the audience receives a narrative that best represents their way of thinking. </li>
      <li>All this bypasses journalism and its mediating role.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>  Mas podemos retomar diálogos com base na tendência para o ano feito o <em>mea culpa.</em></p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p> The maxim that information has less need for traditional mediators to circulate was decisively evident, shaking the already weakened credibility of journalism.</p>
      <p>Journalism needs a new contract of trust with society. This new contract involves a greater effort to get to know the public.<br>

    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It will not be enough to once again convince society our work is important. To respond to disintermediation, journalism will need to <b>deepen its relationship with audiences</b>. This will mean not only to <b>understand them better</b>; it will be critical for us to see that <strong>the audience increasingly understands the contradictions of our practices</strong>. The answer to this mistrust will be to increase transparency and invest more in diversity and collaboration.<br>

    <blockquote>
      <p>As we close out 2018, the idea of letting audience questions drive reporting has become mainstream. It’s a no-brainer way to <b>establish trust</b> and create journalism that audience members will actually find useful. Early successes will prompt journalists to start seeing audience involvement less as a liability to be managed and more as an asset to expand their scope and impact - pushing them to be more creative about the ways they involve non-journalists <span class="voice">(...)</span> if they figure out how to leverage their audience’s expertise and enthusiasm. In 2019, we’ll see the industry invite audience members to make journalism with us.<br>

  <p><small>E o<a href="{{ site.url }}/2018/12/quem-escolhe-quem.html"> <em>diss</em> ao senhores da tv</a> para não deixar cair no esquecimento :)</small></p>
  <p>Ressalva para que se evitem  <em>mea culpas</em> futuras:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> There’s one caveat to giving &quot;jobs to be done&quot; to audience members, though - <b>they’re not signing on to be your labor</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Ressalva importante. O outro <em>caveat</em> subentendido salientamos nós: nunca houve uma cedência voluntária de poderes entre hierarquias. Como os jornalistas se reinventam de <em>gatekeepers</em> neste cenário:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Enter the community organizers</b>: newsrooms will need to professionalize the practice of audience participation, and in 2019, we’ll see the emergence of new newsroom roles to that reflect that.<br>

  <p><em>Takeways</em> finais: </p>
  <p><sup>1)</sup> <b>Autenticidade</b>: chamam-lhe credibilidade quando implica &quot;o outro&quot;.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Perhaps the greatest example of the dichotomy between challenges and opportunities lies in what we understand as credibility. Credibility built in one way only is nothing but a marketing strategy; it needs to be demonstrated in such a way that it can be perceived by the audience.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><sup>2)</sup> Comportamentos sociais e anti-sociais.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Looking closely at the data generated by the users may be a way of getting to know them better. Adapting journalistic products to the behavior of those who consume them will help reestablish a relationship of trust between journalism and its public.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><sup>3)</sup> O cerco aperta, alguns começam a pensar em chegar a termos.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The credibility crisis that the press lives today must more and more contribute to <b>journalists getting out of their fort</b> and asking their readers what it is that makes them not trust what they read in the professional press.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>...mas  velhos hábitos vêm ainda ao de cima: <em>gatekeeper</em> torna-se <em>keep-that-gate</em> porque alcançada a credibilidade e confiança garante-se:</p>
