<p>...<a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/03/subjectivo.html">continuando</a> do resumo de <a href="https://seoulphilosophy.wordpress.com/2015/07/04/charles-taylor-the-ethics-of-authenticity-chapters-6-10/" target="_blank"><b>"kgspencer</b>"</a>. Por esta altura já podemos problematizar a coisa, obviamente, segue-se o habitual <em>&quot;mas...?&quot;:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>But</b> Authenticity only makes sense against an <b>interpersonal background of values and significances</b>, so any discourse on self-fulfillment based on shutting out society is self-defeating. In other words, the self-defeating aspect of the culture of authenticity is its insistence on self-fulfillment in opposition to the demands of society, or nature. We need to separate a &quot;good&quot; ideal of personal authenticity from a &quot;bad&quot; one</p>
  </blockquote>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Authenticity is not the enemy of demands that emanate from beyond the self; it supposes such demands. </div>
<p>E para compreender na sua totalidade a crítica - e resposta encontrada - ao ideal da autenticidade, voltemos ao início. <b>Taylor</b><em> </em>- porque, como nós, sabe que <em>três é um número mágico ;)</em> - <em>finds <b>three dominant malaises</b></em>. São elas:</p>
<div class="info coluna"><blockquote>
<ul class="lista">
  <li><b>Rampant individualism</b>: a loss of meaning  &quot;the fading of moral horizons&quot;   induced by increased individualism. The downside of breaking out of old  hierarchies is a loss of meaning. By assigning a place to each thing and  person, hierarchical societies made the world meaningful. The &quot;dark side of  individualism&quot; is a withdrawal into our own narcissistic pleasures and pains  with little regard for others or society.</li>
  <li><b>The eclipse of ends</b> caused by the rise to dominance of instrumental  reason: sweeping away old social orders disenchants the world and leaves  everything as a resource to be appropriated for our projects. The fear is that  we will use cost-output calculations to measure things that deserve a better  standard of evaluation. The importance of instrumental reason also explains the  prestige of technology and its increased proliferation into areas of life where  it is not optimal.</li>
  <li><b> A loss of freedom brought about by social fragmentation.</b> An instrumental  society &quot;severely restricts our choices,&quot; compelling us to make decisions we  would normally never make. In addition, we lose freedom by being too  self-concerned - a new &quot;soft&quot; despotism that results from a government keeping  us content individually without calling for our participation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></div>
<p>Cada uma  um capítulo por direito próprio que iremos baralhar nas próximas entradas em nome da brevidade. E de  baralhar, saltemos novamente alguns capítulos para adiantar  linhas mestras no pensamento traduzido. Outro <em>&quot;mas&quot;,</em> portanto.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But Taylor&rsquo;s view shows the culture &ldquo;to be full of tension, to be  living an ideal that is not fully comprehended, and which properly understood  would challenge many of its practices&rdquo;. <b>It is this gap between theory and  practice that provides space in which to reason about the culture of self-fulfillment.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>É igualmente esse <em>gap</em> <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/12/webcomics-et-punx.html#parte2">da teoria à prática</a> que nos ocupa: o <b>anti-</b>.</p>
