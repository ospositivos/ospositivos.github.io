  <p>Série <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/03/la-lotta-continua.html"> x de y</a>... Da instrumentalização das relações e da necessidade  de reconhecimento por aqueles que fazem parte.</p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p> The contemporary culture of authenticity frequently sees intimate relationships primarily as tools for self-development, and as a result such relationships are deemed worthy only insofar as they serve that end. <span class="voice">[But]</span> despite its asocial proclamations, the culture of authenticity proposes at least a minimal model of society:<b> &quot;individualism as a moral principle or idea must offer some view on how the individual should live with others&quot;</b>. One such notion is the idea of universal right: all individuals are free to determine themselves. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <p>Sem esse reconhecimento parte da nossa identidade é negada, uma novidade de tempos modernos:</p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Being denied recognition is understood to inflict damage - a form of oppression.  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Recognition</b> and <b>identity</b> are features of any society and person, but until now these were largely extensions of one’s <b>social position</b>. Only in a culture of authenticity in which <b>one must work for recognition to craft one’s identity</b> can that recognition fail, and that is why recognition has become a topic of such importance in modern society.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Em contraste com <em>importâncias</em> passadas: honra <em>vs</em> dignidade, a paz de não ter escolhas <em>vs</em> a conturbada negociação de um identidade em luta.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <ul class="lista">
    <li>In strongly hierarchical societies, recognition takes the form of honor, a distinction <span class="voice">[that]</span> only make sense if it's rare and elevate one above the others.The relationship of honor to identity is relatively straightforward - I am defined largely by the social position I am in <b>with little pressure or opportunity to modify that identity</b>. </li>
    <li>Modern society is more interested in dignity, a universal, innate, and egalitarian form of recognition. In the case of a dignity-based society, <b>I am compelled to grapple with my identity and to create it through my action</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>E, repetindo, sempre em dança com os outros:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>My discovering my identity doesn’t mean that I work it out in isolation but that I negotiate it through dialogue, partly overt, partly internalized, with others.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Bolinha cheia agora, ou círculos completos: relações instumentais de <em>self-fulfillment</em> e opções banais pelo valor da escolha, e não podemos terminar uma entrada em identidades sem falar de homem <em>vs</em> mulher:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To come full circle: can relationships be merely instrumental to self-fulfillment? On the social level, it might seem like the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; that all cultures keep their distance from each other. However, merely recognizing &quot;choice&quot; results in banality, and so it makes no sense for cultures simply to keep their distance from each other.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote> If men and women are equal, it is not because they are different, but because overriding the difference are some properties, common or complementary, which are of value. They are beings capable of reason, or love, or memory, or dialogical recognition. To come together on a mutual recognition of difference — that is, of the equal value of different identities — requires that we share more than a belief in this principle; we have to share also some standards of value on which the identities concerned check out as equal. There must be some substantive agreement on value, or else the formal principle of equality will be empty and a sham.</blockquote>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>On the intimate level relationships cannot be merely instrumental to self-fulfillment. It is these relationships that in fact form identity <span class="voice">[and]</span> denying the self-forming role of relationships flies in the face of actual authenticity: if my self-exploration takes the form of such serial and in principle temporary relationships, then it is not my identity that I am exploring, but some modality of enjoyment.</p>
