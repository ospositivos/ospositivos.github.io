<h2 class="subtitle">to separate "manner" from "matter" of the ideal of authenticity</h2>
<div class="coluna">
  <p>Regressamos às nuances de linguagens subtis – ie, gaijos que <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/04/pode-ser-que-passe.html">não  sabem escrever</a> - e <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/04/entrevista-francisco-louca.html">visões autonomistas</a> que se isolam da sociedade: quando  a fragmentação social conduz a uma espécie de democracia não-democrática.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Fragmentation means the atomization of society  with people seeing themselves increasingly as less bound to others by common  projects and allegiances. Even where some common projects exist, their scope is  smaller than society as a whole. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Essa é <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/03/maleitas.html">uma das maleitas</a> que acossam a <b>autenticidade</b>, a contrariar com  <em>horizontes</em> que se estendem além do <em>eu</em>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Authenticity is clearly self-referential: this  has to be my orientation. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that my goals must express or  fulfill my desires or aspirations, as against something that stands beyond  these. We will find genuine fulfilment only in something which has significance  independent of us or our desires. <b>We  don&rsquo;t need to see ourselves as set in a universe that we can consider simply as  a source of raw material for our projects. We may still need to see ourselves  as part of a larger order that can make claims on us.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Exemplo, <sup>i)</sup> Arte. E aqui recordamos estamos a registar <em>cites,</em> não seria o exemplo maior a sair por  nossa iniciativa mas igualmente merecedor de nota:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>    Art&rsquo;s balancing of the manner/matter  distinction regarding authenticity helps point the way in the larger ongoing  cultural struggle over authenticity.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> The  poet now must invent the language to express the idea they want to convey [and] make us aware of something in nature for  which there are as yet no adequate words</div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>    Modern art's task of mimesis gives way to one  of creation. <span class="voice">[Previous]</span> aesthetic principles <span class="voice">[&amp;]</span> codes no longer function  <span class="voice">[and have]</span> been largely dispensed with. That&rsquo;s not to say that <span class="voice">[art]</span> cannot  draw on these older doctrines, just that they cannot have the fixed meaning  they would have in an earlier time: <b>&quot;the poet articulate his own world of  references, and make them believable&quot;</b>.</p>
    <p>    In modern art, we understand meaning not as  given across various artists and works, but as worked out by a particular  work or artist. <b>Understanding requires attending to the individual work or  artist&rsquo;s manner of expressing</b>.<b> That is not to say, though, that all art become  merely a &quot;personal vision,&quot; aka a &quot;subjectification of manner.&quot; </b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    De que <em>maneira</em> esta <em>matéria</em> importa, perguntam-se os  mais impacientes. A resposta é a mesma atrás: o que dizes não é indiferente a como o dizes, e chegados ao segundo exemplo maior a recordar. Depois da arte e antes da arte e ao lado da arte, <sup>ii)</sup> Natureza.  </p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="voice">[Contra]</span> the <b>subjectivist bias</b> that both<b> instrumental reason</b> and <b>the ideologies of  self-centred fulfilment</b> make <b>dominant</b> in our time <span class="voice">[it]</span> would greatly help to stave off ecological disaster if we could <b>recover a sense of the demand that our natural surroundings and wilderness make on us</b>, <strong>recovering something like a sacred reverence of nature and  our connectedness to it.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>
<p>...versus <em>&quot;domínio&quot;:</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>    An anthropocentric environmentalism <b>is not the ideal ally</b> because it still  relies on nature as a resource that is good for us; it&rsquo;s not such a far leap  for this instrumental calculation to flip back over to the destruction of the  environment.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>Bias</em> subjectivo na  razão instrumental e ideologias de realização ego-antropocêntricas e  <em>domínios</em> de <em>horizontes</em> que se estendem além dos nuances da linguagem a devolverem-nos <em><b>ourselves  as part of a larger order:</b></em></p>
