  <blockquote>
    <p>Taylor interprets post-Romantic versions of the self to involve a curious blend of self-discovery and self-expression: <b>we must become what we really are in our own individual, original way, yet this becoming needs some form of expression to be fully realized</b>. This link between <b>self-discovery and expression</b> accounts for the increasingly revered role of the artist after Romanticism as well as <em>a </em>shift thinking <b>what &quot;art&quot; is</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Mover as pessoas, uma espécie de sentimento estético desligado da representação porque o artista é puro e pouco convencional, quase imoral: originalidade como inimigo da conformidade.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Whereas art’s primary duty previously was <b>mimesis</b>, the representation of reality, its job increasingly comes to be seen as one of moving people: The specificity of art and beauty cease to be defined in terms of the reality or its manner of depiction and come to be identified by the<b> kinds of feeling</b> they arouse in use. In a word, <b>aesthetics</b> is born. On the other hand, the artist as creative comes to be valorized as a purest crystallization of the self-making person <span class="voice">[and]</span> this emphasis on self-making blends into a generalized anti-conventionalism, and <b>&quot;self-definition comes early to be contrasted to morality&quot;</b>. The very idea of <b>originality</b>, and the associated notion that the enemy of authenticity can be social <b>conformity</b>, forces on us the idea that<b> authenticity will have to struggle against some externally imposed rules</b>.</p>

  <h3 class="centre">e-MORAL</h3>
  <p>De ideias chegamos àqueles que as têm e as práticas que lhes sugerem, com os mais maluquinhos a ter as ideias mais estranhas.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Authenticity requires the deepest aspects to be embraced and brought to light, but &quot;morality as normally understood obviously involves crushing much that is elemental and instinctive in us, many of our deepest and most powerful desires&quot;, <b>an explicitly anti-moral ethos develops that embraces immorality</b>, such as the cult of violence that pervaded various early 20th Century aesthetic movements and, incidentally, helped lay the foundations of <b>Fascism</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Não podemos filosofar de fascismos sem o Frederico à chamada, a quem  Taylor acrescenta à sua  habitual falácia em <strong>autenticidade</strong> uma outra de lógica.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Taylor faults the Nietzschean-cum-Postmodern side of authenticity for stressing the constructed, creative side of our &quot;expressive languages&quot; to the point of <b>embracing amoralism</b>, but they ignore the horizon of significance and dialogic setting that binds us to others. This notion of authenticity insofar as it embraces <b>radical freedom is just the problem</b>: self-determining freedom pushed to its limit doesn’t recognize any boundaries, anything given that I have to respect in my exercise of self-determining choice, and the consequence is the erasure of horizons of significance.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p>At one moment, we understand our situation as one of high tragedy, along in a silent universe, without intrinsic meaning, condemned to create value. But at a later moment, the same doctrine, by its own inherent bent, yields a flattened world, in which there aren’t very meaningful choices because there aren’t any crucial issues. With the fading of horizons of significance, self-determination takes on a more important role, leading to the vicious circle of valorizing choice for in a degraded version of authenticity.</p>

  <h3 class="centre">Cultura popular, <em>hight</em>, academês.</h3>
  <p> E no tópico de<em> degraded versions of authenticity,</em> o extra especialmente fofinho a tópicos habituais neste espaço. Escolhemos fechar capítulo nesses, algures entre o resumo <em>so far </em>e o <em>fuck you</em> académico onde banda desenhada rasteira se torna <em>paper</em> para tese de encher repositório.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>What makes the ideal of authenticity devolve into the culture of self-fulfillment?</b> The social causes for the slide are several, [as] contemporary culture sanctions both <sup>i)</sup> &quot;social atomism&quot; and <sup>ii)</sup> &quot;radical anthropocentrism&quot;, regarding <sup>iii)</sup> social relationships as instrumental to self-fulfillment and <sup>iv)</sup> &quot;neglecting or delegitimating demands that come from beyond our own desires or aspirations, be they from history, tradition, society, nature&quot;. However there are &quot;reasons internal to the ideal of authenticity that facilitate the slide&quot;, <sup>A)</sup> a <b>popular</b> one and <sup>B)</sup> an <b>&quot;high&quot; cultural</b> one -<b> and the dominant trends in post-modernism focus on A at the expense of B</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Citados como subscrevendo <sup>A)</sup> sobre <sup>B)</sup>: <b>Nietzsche</b>, <b>Baudelaire</b>, <b>Marinetti</b> e os Futuristas, <b>Antonin Artaud</b>, <b>Georges Bataille</b>, <b>Foucault</b>, <b>Derrida</b>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A theme throughout some of these thinker's work (especially Foucault and Derrida) is <b>a questioning of all values and the implicit or explicit rejection of standards imposed by the world</b>. They leave<b> &quot;the agent, even with all his or her doubts of the ‘self,’ with a sense of untrammeled power and freedom before a world that imposes no standards, ready to enjoy the ‘free play,’ or to indulge in an aesthetics of the self&quot;</b>. </p>
    <p>It is in university students that the high-cultural and the popular slides to subjectivism meet, and the academic slide &quot;further strengthens the self-centered modes, gives them<b> a certain patina of deeper philosophical justification</b>&quot;.</p>
