  <p>De login feito ao <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/04/back-in-tha-digital-cage.html">digital</a> a nossa desculpa para recuperar um  artigo de <b>Jeffrey Zeldman</b> <sup class="asterisk">(*)</sup> <span class="sidenote sidenote-right">Para um autor tão fundamental em web-cenas, não o <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/04/tecnologia-manifesta.html">citamos</a> <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/09/going-mainstream.html">vezes</a> <a href="{{ site.url }}/2018/12/mediacao-totalitaria.html">suficientes</a>.</span> no <em><b>A List Apart</b></em> em web e <em><b>&quot;the reason small  companies created by idealists too frequently turn into consumer-defrauding  forces for evil&quot;</b>. </em>Obviamente, <b>autenticidade</b>, pela volta maior.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>From <b>our  naive belief that content wants to be free</b>, and <b>our inability to create  businesses that pay for themselves</b>, we are<b> turning our era&rsquo;s greatest  inventions into engines of doom and despair</b>. Here it  would be easy to blame capitalism, but this isn&rsquo;t a complaint about late stage  capitalism per se, although it may smell like one.<br>

  <p>Destaque primeiro e sobretudo ao <em>doin' it for tha peeps, </em>um  zine por qualquer nome que lhe queiram chamar: </p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Websites  and internet startups used to be you and your friends making cool stuff for  your other friends, and maybe building new friendships and even small  communities in the process.</b> (Even in 2019, that’s still how some websites and  startups begin — as labors of love, fashioned by idealists in their spare  time.)</p>
      <p>Because  they are labors of love; because we’ve spent 25 years training people to  believe that websites, and news, and apps, and services should be free;  because, when we begin a project, we can scarcely believe anyone will ever  notice or care about it - <b>for these reasons and more, the things we make  digitally, especially on the web, are offered free of charge.</b> We labor on,  excited by positive feedback, and delighted to discover that, if we keep at it,  our little community will grow.<br>

  <p>Aqui o twist que transforma esta nossa <em>peça</em> em tragédia e outros caem pelo caminho: <em><b>&quot;content wants to be paid&quot;</b>,</em> e onde se instala a dúvida ou demasiada certeza encontramos o chifrudo a tentar alminhas.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Most such  labors of love disappear after a year or two, as the creators drift out of  touch with each other, get &ldquo;real&rdquo; jobs, fall in love, start families, or simply  lose interest due to lack of attention from the public or the frustrations of  spending weekends and holidays grinding away at an underappreciated site or app  while their non-internet friends spend those same hours either having fun or  earning money.<br>

  <blockquote>
    <p>But some of  these startup projects catch on. And when they do, a certain class of investor  smells ROI. They want an obscene  profit right away, or a brutal loss, which they can write off their taxes. And the naive cofounders, who never expected their product or  service to really get anywhere, can suddenly envision themselves rich and  Zuckerberg-famous. Or maybe they like the idea of quitting their day job,  believing in themselves, and really going for it. Or maybe the founders are  problem solvers, with enough capital, and a slightly bigger team, they can show  the world how to do it right...<br>

  <p>Também este é um capítulo que se escreve neste momento um pouco por todo o lado<em></em>. É pela nova geração senhores, este é um <i>labor of luv</i> que não vamos desistir.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Here we  are. Now what do we do about it? <b>Maybe those kinds of startups don&rsquo;t need to  make a buck — maybe they can simply be labors of love,</b> like the websites we  loved in the 1990s and early 2000s. But does an  IndieWeb approach scale to the general public? If it doesn&rsquo;t scale yet, <b>can we,  who envision and design and build, create a new generation of tools that will  help give birth to a flourishing, independent web?</b><br>
