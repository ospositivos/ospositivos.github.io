  <p>Beja e aquela altura do ano. Provavelmente não vamos e se formos desta vez <a href="{{ site.url }}/2018/06/aos-miudos-do-amanha.html">gamamos um poster à má fila</a>, mas somos chamados a outro tipo de <em>homecoming.</em> A <b>Bedeteca de Beja</b> atribui <b>Prémio Geraldes Lino</b> <sup>2019</sup> a <b>Patrícia Guimarães</b> com fanzine <em>&quot;Pêra Verde&quot;</em> – parece-nos, não sabemos, não  tentámos descobrir  –, a nossa deixa a repetir repto de uma <em>queer white female</em> <em>zinester and zine  librarian  </em>aos <em>teens: </em><a href="http://anomalily.net/the-indie-web-is-the-new-zines/" target="_blank"><em>&quot;<b>The Indie Web is the new Zines&quot;</b></em></a>, como em <em>&quot;só trabalho com  um braço, obrigado - usa os dois porra!...&quot;</em><blockquote>
    <p><b>I see the  Indie Web as a pretty direct correlation to 1980&rsquo;s and 1990&rsquo;s zine culture. </b>The  method of production may be completely different (photocopiers and direct mail  vs web posts and servers) but the goals are almost identical – controlling the  way in which your message and identity are displayed, crafted, and stored while  avoiding censorship that corporate media might impose. The end goal of both  zine and indieweb technologies is <b>ownership of your own identity</b> without a  filter. Indieweb technology allows the individual to <b>control their own narrative</b>. <br>

  <p>Sabemos que<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-indie-social-media-save-us" target="_blank"> <em>&quot;to be sixteen and offline has become countercultural&quot;</em></a> <sup>19  maio 2019</sup>,  e o primitivista em nós pula de alegria à volta da fogueira, muito como ser <em>artsy</em> e infoexcluído preguiça  cultural e o primitivista em nós quer empurrar esses ao lume, mas não estaríamos a  cumprir serviço público se não insistíssemos aos miúdos (a terceira idade  que  por esta altura ainda não o sabe também pode saltar no fogo):</p>

    <p> <b>Your  content is not just something you happen to have created – and for which you  own the copyright of, by the way – but it is also part of your identity.</b> It is  part of who you are, what you&rsquo;re thinking about, what you believe in, and what  you&rsquo;re up to. It is part of the story you are about to tell. It is part of the  change you seek to make. Your content is one of your most valuable assets and  thus owning it is invaluable. If you decide to publish your work on a platform  like <b>Medium</b>, you&rsquo;re giving away control over it. One day, <b>Twitter</b> and other  publishing platforms like <b>Facebook</b>, <b>Instagram</b> will indeed die, like  so many sites before them. And every time this happens, we lose most of the  content we created and with it a fair amount of our collective cultural  history.<br>

  <p><em>Collective cultural history,</em> terceira peça de hoje, entrada  do <b>Comics Work Book</b> em <em><strong>&quot;digital ways of seeing&quot; </strong></em>para concluir a nossa  tentativa de endoutrinação.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>With the  explosion of instantaneous visual communication across the internet, visual  forms, digitally transferred, can essentially be considered as shared  experiences. This allows for users to collectively &quot;see&quot; the world through a  shared viewpoint. <b>Websites ARE the expressions of that thought.</b><br>

    <p>Everything  expressed in &quot;recordable&quot; communication IS an idea within the legal framework.  Organizations with corporate money have the power to take away certain &quot;sides&quot;  of information. Duh. That kind of power can shape the mass of collective  knowledge, that is the basis from which we collectively determine &quot;truth&quot;. <br>

    <p>When there  is an intermediary between those creating media and the consumption of said  media, there is a potential for that narrative to be suppressed. Within  cultures of oppression (patriarchy, classism, racism), the dominant power  controls the narrative through the methods of distribution (such as newspapers,  magazines, television.) Both zines and the Indie Web are alternative  distribution models.<br>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>The  personal website</b>. It&rsquo;s a place to write, create, and share whatever you like, without  the need to ask for anyone&rsquo;s permission. It is totally up to you what you  create and because you have unlimited shots on the Web, you can try out  different formats, different styles, different topics. Regardless of what other  people might think and although it might not work. Creation is free. Personal  websites are called personal websites because they are just that: personal. The  primary objective still is to have a place to express ourselves, to explore  ourselves, a place that lasts while the daily storms pass by.<br>
