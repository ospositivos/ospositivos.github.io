  <p>Pensávamos ser dos poucos a trilhar comparações menos óbvias  entre BD e os media, especial edição online, mas o <em><b>The Beat</b></em> conseguiu admissão  ao clube com uma entrada do meio do mês onde perfaz <a href="{{ site.url}}/2019/06/weirdos.html">uma triangulação</a> com vértice igualmente improvável: sindicatos. Segue-se nota desses, media, e comics.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>For  comics publishers, the cast of characters may be different, but the  circumstances are largely the same.</b><br>
      The  number of unionized workers in internet publishing has increased a whopping  20-fold since 2010. To understand why there&rsquo;s been an uptick in support for  unions, it&rsquo;s necessary to understand the economic realities of <b>online media  and publishing</b> in 2019. Here&rsquo;s a hypothetical: a publisher experiences  financial hardship as they attempt to navigate the turbulent waters of today&rsquo;s  media climate. Ad revenue is down, views and circulation are down, everything&rsquo;s  down except for costs (which are going up). In walks Messrs. Hedge Fund and  Venture Capital. Like Joel Osteen or Tony Robbins, they promise a better way  with a perfect smile and shiny suit. And you? Well, you&rsquo;re not in much of a  position to refuse them. You let yourself be taken in by promises of  maintaining operational independence and profitability. The road to black is  paved conspicuously with layoffs, slashed budgets, and ill-conceived attempts  to rebrand. A few years later, one of two things will likely occur. One: You  operate an empty vessel who invokes the specter of independence and  objectivity, without follow through. Two: You will no longer exist.<br>

  <p> E da relação óbvia de banda desenhada / media regressamos ao cartoon editorial para o caso do mês: o <em><b>NTY</b></em> deixar cair da sua edição  internacional o que restava desses por via do polémico <em>republish</em> do cartoon  do português António Antunes. Uma <em>bittersweet</em> <a href="{{ site.url }}/2016/10/ted-rall-vs-matt-bors.html">à evolução do formato</a> e nova geração:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> It&rsquo;s undeniable that editorial cartooning, even  more than journalism as a whole, is in crisis. A 2012 report by the Herblock  Foundation found that there were fewer than 40 editorial cartoonists with  newspaper-staff jobs in America, a steep decline from more than 2,000 such  positions in the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
    <p> Yet the impulse to deploy images in the service  of politics continues, even if staff jobs are scarce. A new generation of  alternative cartoonists have emerged who are most often to be found online.  Distinguished names include <b>Matt Bors</b>, <b>Tom Tomorrow</b>, <b>Eli Valley</b>,<b> Pia Guerra</b>, <b>Matt Lubchansky</b>, <b>Ruben Bolling</b>, <b>Kasia Babis</b>, and <b>Jen Sorensen</b>.<br>

  <p> …E uma ao contraste de BD e sátira, uma questão de classe:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The Times has long viewed editorial cartoons  with sniffy disdain. For most of its existence, the Times, along with The Wall  Street Journal, was one of the few newspapers that ran no cartoons at all. If  the Times has a cartoon allergy<b>, this is partly a matter of class.</b> As an  upscale newspaper, the Times prefers to present itself as objective and above  the fray. By contrast, the publishers who have done the most to promote  cartooning of all sorts, William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, were  media ruffians, guilty of &ldquo;yellow journalism&rdquo; and exciting plebeian anger.</p>
    <p> As Bennet <span class="voice">[Times editorial-page editor]</span> admits,  the bluntness of cartoons goes against his own sensibility. It is revealing  that Bennet singled out for praise the Pulitzer Prize–winning stories in comics  form about Syrian refugees that Jake Halperin and Michael Sloan did for the  Times. These are excellent works of reported cartooning (in the tradition of  Joe Sacco&rsquo;s work), rather than satire. It&rsquo;s hardly surprising that someone as  committed to elite concord as Bennet would be so uncomfortable with editorial  cartoons, an art form that at its best is agitational, subversive, and  nose-tweaking.<br>

  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> In  intent, a cartoon is closer to a burnt effigy or a voodoo doll than it is to a  reasoned essay. The goal is to wound.</div>
  <div class="info coluna"><blockquote>
    <p><b>Editorial cartoons have power to upset people  that words rarely match. As a visual form, cartoons travel at the speed of  light, whereas a speech travels at the speed of sound and written words are  slowed down by the effort of the eye to riddle them out. As you plod word by  word through this sentence, you can&rsquo;t untangle the full meaning until you reach  the end. By contrast, a cartoon hits you like a punch in the eye.</b><br>
