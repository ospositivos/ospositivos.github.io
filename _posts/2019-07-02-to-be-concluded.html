  <p>...começa o último parágrafo do <em>&quot;To Be Continued&quot;</em> no <b>TCJ</b>. Razões dessa obsolescência tripartidas (aquilo dos três...) entre <sup>i) </sup><em>&quot;their repugnant behavior&quot;, </em><sup>ii) </sup><em>&quot;their continued financial ineptitude&quot;</em> e <sup>iii)</sup><em> &quot;some because they just don't seem to care about this stuff anymore&quot;</em>, terminando com promessa: <em>&quot;it's my aim that the Journal will <b>take the pulse of those things</b>&quot;</em>.</p>
  <p>Este sentido de missão é reconhecido à espécie, e contra a <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/01/money.html">contínua extinção</a> de blogs e outras fontes de informação nacionais nas <em>intrawebs</em> ao tema passamos palavra às novas gerações a jeito de requisitos às funções:</p>

    <p>We're here to document the passing of its participants, and to ask its newest generation what it is they're seeking to contribute. We're here to wave a dismissive hand at work created by people who dismiss their obligation to not suck. We're here to get overly excited about minute details in a work that you'll never be able to see, but that you'll think about for too long. <b>We're here to pump your brakes, and we're here to get your engine going. </b><br>

  <p>A que cada um faça o que pode à causa. E voltando às<em> old guard institutions</em> em decadência, a nossa promessa-à-missão: <b>OS POSITIVOS</b>, o nosso <em>aim</em> é <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/07/faux-left-provocateur.html">acelerar a queda</a>.</p>
