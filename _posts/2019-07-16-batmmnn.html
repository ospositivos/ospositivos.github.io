<article class="clip"><h1 class="centre">Ocuppy Gotham</h1>
  <p>A thousand  issues have gone by, nearly 80 years have passed, and Batman still hasn't  cleaned up Gotham. If the formal definition of insanity is trying the same  thing and expecting a different outcome, then Bruce Wayne belongs in a group  therapy session in Arkham Asylum. Seriously, get that guy some cognitive  behavioral therapy before he gets into some serious trouble. </p>
  <p>As Upton  Sinclair wrote in his limited run of Batman: Class War, <em>&quot;It is difficult  to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not  understanding it!&quot;</em> </p>
  <p>    Gotham is a  city riven by inequality. In 1939, that prospect had a very different valence  than it has in 2018. Back in 1939, the wealth of the world's elites had been  seriously eroded, first by the Great War, then by the Great Crash and the  interwar Great Depression, and what was left of those vast fortunes was being  incinerated on the bonfire of World War II. Billionaire plutocrats were a  curious relic of a nostalgic time before the intrinsic instability of extreme  wealth inequality plunged the world into conflict. </p>
  <p>The scions  of these once-great fortunes were almost tragic figures, Gatsbyesque rogues who  had been hand-raised on Kobe calves and then pushed out into a world where they  were expected to live as paupers, not princelings. The idea of Bruce Wayne  being qualified to drive around Gotham beating the shit out of people he judged  to be criminals by dint of his having had the enormous good judgment to emerge  from the uterus of a person who had married a billionaire was quaint, not  sinister. </p>
  <p>But 80  years later, it's worth revisiting this situation. Gotham appears to be a <strong>hereditary  meritocracy</strong>, a place where commanding enormous power by dint of birth is  somehow compatible with capitalism's supposed capacity for rewarding  extraordinary achievements with extraordinary wealth.</p>
  <p>    In 2018,  hereditary meritocracies are no longer quaint. America—a land that was founded  on the idea of the intrinsic corruption of hereditary transfers of power—has  become a land of hereditary meritocracy, where intergenerational wealth  transfers by the very  wealthiest 0.1%  are considered to be only moral, because  Consider that the Americans of Earth One  elected president a man who describes his humbling beginnings by explaining  that he had to confront the New York real estate market equipped with nothing  more than a $100.000.00 loan from his father. FCK. </p>
  <p>    Perhaps this  can be ascribed to the fact that America is a nation of <em>&ldquo;temporarily embarrassed  millionaires,&rdquo;</em> but surely some of the prevailing equivocation of extreme wealth  with virtue is due to the cognitive dissonance of living in a world where we  are ever-more subject to the wills and whims of the super-rich. If we're to be  buffeted by the downdrafts of their jets, copters and performance cars, we can  at least comfort ourselves by imagining that they are traveling on some wise  errand that benefits us all.</p>
  <p>    Bruce Wayne,  whose accident of birth and tragedy of boyhood turned him into the guardian of  Gotham, has made no progress to speak of in nearly a century of crime fighting.  Gotham is still riven by inequality and super-villainy, in which sociopaths  have no trouble finding desperate ruffians to fight on their behalf, nor in marshaling  the funds to equip their armies with the most advanced and fanciful weaponry.</p>
  <p>To any  rational observer it's blinding obvious that Gotham doesn't have a crime problem:  it has a corruption problem that expresses itself in crime. Doubtless.  there is plenty of skullduggery offstage—zero bid contracts to civil  engineering conglomerates to undertake chic projects that are never completed  or fall don shortly after their ribbons are cut by mayors whose campaigns are  financed by kickbacks from the same contractors.</p>
  <p>    But Bruce  Wayne is only interested in fighting symptoms, not the underlying disease. Can  you blame him? Bruce Wayne can look in the mirror and see a scared little boy  who will never avenge his parents' murder, but he can't ever see a plutocrat  whose comfort, influence, power and impunity is derived from his unearned  privilege. It is difficult to get a superhero to understand something when his  R&amp;D lab depends on him not understanding it, after all.</p>
