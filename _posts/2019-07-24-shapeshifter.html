  <blockquote>
    <p>Lin's book gracefully bypasses feeling derivative with its focus on emotional minutiae and professional life over deep-dive soul searching, and a consistently surprising sense of humor.<br>

  <p>A comparação no <b>TCJ</b> ao mais recente de <b>Hartley Lin</b> contra os seus trabalhos anteriores servir-nos-á de exemplo a outras  comparações. Primeiro acto, o bom:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lin and his one-man anthology Pope Hats have earned admittance to an elevated circle with Tomine, DeForge, Seth. A clear descendant of the Comics for Smart People made by the Mount Rushmore guys whose books it's shelved next to.<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Segundo acto, o não-tão-bom:</p>
  <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Not a few just feel empty.  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Part of setting a high bar as an artist is that subsequent failures to clear it will be met with negativity that the work in a vacuum doesn't necessarily merit <span class="voice">[ and ]</span> personal investment in reaching a higher level just isn't visible in panel after panel of this book, on page after page — characters look vaguer, less distinct, just collections of comics-shorthand tricks.<br>

<p>Poderá haver uma razão para essa sucessão de <i>comics-shorthand tricks</i> e vazio de<em> personal investment in reaching a higher level </em>num autor que nos habituou à liga dos <em><b>Comics for Smart People</b>?</em> <em>Segway </em>ao nosso destaque em comparações.</p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p>Shapeshifter is an example of a subgenre that's really boomed in the decade Lin's been publishing, <b>the I've-got-a-kid-now comic</b>. It's a niche with pros and cons like any other — the potential for high drama and emotional stakes is clear, as are the risks of falling into triteness and pabulum. There's a huge captive audience for birth-and-parenting comics, and a similar number of people who'll have to strain to care. Full disclosure: I count among the latter group.</p>
    </blockquote>
  <small class="centre"><em>( full disc: </em><b>OS POSITIVOS</b> são do contra e contra-ao-contra )</small></div>
  <p>Acto final que  rachamos em duas frentes: <em>tha ugly.</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><sup class="voice">[ i ]</sup> It's difficult assigning value to work this clearly personal, but Lin's playing in the big leagues now, and there's a value assigned to Shapeshifter on the corner of its back cover: $6.95, which for the first time in Pope Hats' run you could spend more wisely elsewhere.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><sup class="voice">[ ii ]</sup> Comics about having and raising kids tend to subtly ascribe a moral dignity to the endeavor, yet the tender daddy mommy comics rankle. In a world where every human's carbon footprint is an established fact and there are scores of suffering children who need absolutely nothing more or more urgently than a non-biological parent's love, they can chronicle amorality and self-obsession as much as sacrifice. <br>

  <p>Ora, <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/07/e-um-crook.html">também esta nos parece fácil</a>: falem aos miúdos, não falem dos miúdos. E igualmente tão importante: não metam um preço na capa.</p>
