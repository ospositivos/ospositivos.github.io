    <p>Desabafo de um jornalista quando o <em>&quot;the #1 most-read&quot; article </em>do<em> day &quot;</em> foi produzido por uma rotina computacional, <em>pretty</em> básica pela descrição, <em>&quot;no cutting-edge AI at hand here -- it's just good-old &quot;rule-based phrases and terms we wrote beforehand&quot;.</em> Diz-nos o humano,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>AI isn’t a threat to the workforce, and its future is collaborative. Also, robots aren’t that good at writing, so I don’t need to worry about my own job. But there’s one thing I forgot to consider: how it feels to have a never-tiring, high-performing robot colleague. Being a somewhat neurotic human specimen, I couldn’t help but take this deeply personal and have an intense emotional response.<br>

    <p>O resto do texto cicla entre a desejável relação de simbiose colaborativa humano-máquina e o receio da mesma.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>We probably don’t need to worry though, as bots will never reach human-level of creativity. Bots are undeniably going to improve loads of fields as they’re far better at solving the tasks we set them up to do than we are. So where does that leave writing?<br>

    <p>Dado o tópico, escrita, relevante às teses enquanto peça de um puzzle maior. Exemplo: jornalismo.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Journalism’s goal of finding hidden truths is hard to quantify — which is probably one of the reasons so many publications are failing. Being vague from a quantitative perspective means that the ‘metrics’ of journalism are difficult to stick a price on. And even harder for an AI to learn.<br>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Mas, mesmo exemplo, o seu reverso à graça daquela outra criatividade humana, o <b>$$$</b></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The bot isn’t the villain, it’s metrics. Maximizing pageviews is the only goal this bot has, and can optimize ruthlessly for. The money has to come from somewhere, which means derivative metrics like pageviews are applied to measure overall success of publishing. Not in the least because eyeballs are what advertisers pay for, in the end.<br>

    <p>Passe palavra ao <b>BB</b> que resume o essencial.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p> There's an obvious discomfort at realizing a bot can author a top-viewed story, because of course in a publishing operation, money comes from reader clicks; if a deathless, tireless, un-unionizable bot can deliver those clicks, that's unsettling for all the meatbag authors. Sure, bots can outperform humans at routine drudge work. But this frees the humans up to do the complex, thoughtful, high-EQ stuff that humans are at the moment uniquely capable of, right? Fair enough, in theory. Except our economy mostly has no idea how to value those supposedly superior &quot;human&quot; skills — today's firms are mostly obsessed with measuring output, which is where bots excel.<br>
