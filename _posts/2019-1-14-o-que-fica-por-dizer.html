<small class="centre"><i>1 day ago: money can't buy</i></small>

<p>So, we-back. And greeted with a reminder from heaven and hell: <b>time = money</b> (<a href="https://bedeteca.wordpress.com/2019/01/13/tempo-dinheiro/" target="_blank">divided  by some other nonsense</a> <sup>13 jan 2019</sup>).  U folks  know how we like tha roll tha dices: tha <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/01/o-que-se-diz.html">sayin&rsquo; goes</a> <em><b>&quot;realize how arbitrary rules are in the  first place&quot;</b>,</em> so we might as well try tha read into tea leaves to make sense of  it all. It&rsquo;s scientific,<em> fer sure.</em> </p>
<p>Aa-a-a-nd shiiit: we like to think there's something to be said on tha   particular sequence above. You know: reading the inbetweens of tha   universe and drawing straight lines outta chaos. And we like to think.   And we like to say shit. Let's get this show on tha road, shall we?</p>
<p>Case u were  wondering, our two cents:</p>
<div class="info coluna"><ul class="lista">
  <li>30k - 4.5k / 3 = 8500 - taxes =  6,375 / 14 months = grand total of 455.36 month for a fulltime job (two hundred pages graphic novel) on  contractual obligations. </li>
  <li>Fuck that, get a job, do ur comix without strings attached.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Rather have tha time than tha money: <b>don't fuck with my time, u can't afford it</b>.</p>
