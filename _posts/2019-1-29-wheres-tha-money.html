  <blockquote>
    <p>A long-predicted collapse hit digital media. For an industry that has grown accustomed to layoffs, it all should have seemed like more of the same. And yet, the week felt more apocalyptic than usual. That’s because the “corrections” are coming for the digital outlets that were supposed to have been the survivors.<br>

  <p>Esses <em>outlets</em> digital-nativos: os infantes terríveis <b>BuzzFeed</b> &amp; <b>Huffington Post</b>. Mas os <em>legacy media</em> não se estão a rir, apesar do escárnio tomavam essas publicações como ponta de lança em terrenos - digitais - por desbravar, e as opções são agora francamente mais reduzidas.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>BuzzFeed &amp; Huffington Post: the two sites would help create an online media boom, as investors rushed to buy stakes in the belief such outlets were more nimble and more in tune with the desires of readers who grew up on the internet rather than with traditional newspapers and broadcasters. On Wednesday, HuffPost’s parent company, Verizon Media Group, and BuzzFeed both announced plans to lay off hundreds of staff. <b>The news signalled a collision between the dream of an online media boom and the accountants’ harsher reality: questions over the long-term profitability of digital media companies, and, as a result, concerns over the future of online journalism itself.</b><br>

  <p>O primeiro mês do novo ano já cimentou no consciente colectivo o <em>pivot-to-subscription,</em> solução insuportável a longo prazo que tende a concentrar sobre as marcas mais conhecidas, e mesmo estas, desconfiamos, não o poderão manter por muito tempo sem os dividendos inesperados do <em>Trump bump.</em></p>

  <p>Mas...</p>

    <p>Seeking money on absurdly inflated subscription rates works for The New Yorker, because The New Yorker is the One Magazine—the winner in a suddenly winner-take-all market. Can subscriptions sustain a large and diverse media ecosystem—one already dominated by a few huge players that already charge subscriptions? How many newsrooms can we expect individual consumers to directly fund?<br>

  <p>O <em>big picture </em>então.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We already knew that local newspapers were near the bottom of their death spirals, running with skeleton crews as hedge funds bleed them dry. The legacy brands, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and even the Los Angeles Times, are doing fine for the moment, thanks largely to the Trump bump and billionaire owners, but nobody thinks that’s a sustainable trajectory for industry growth. So that left BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vice, and Vox, which weren’t exactly expected to keep growing forever, but which we hoped would make it long enough to hire us when we got laid off from Mic, Mashable, Gizmodo Media Group, or Vocativ. What became clear this week is that if the digital natives do survive, it might not have much to do with newsgathering, which both investors and advertisers have recently discovered an allergy to.<br>

      <p>The brands want to spend pennies to reach millions, and ensure that their ads never appear anywhere potentially controversial. <b>News is not a pathway to that future</b>. The old arrangement, where if you wanted your ads to reach Rolling Stone‘s prosperous young readers you had no choice but to subsidize Hunter Thompson calling the White House a den of thieves, did not survive the digital revolution.</p>
      <p>The investors who pumped money into the new media companies now realize, as a few others quietly did back when they were investing that money, that with herculean effort and a few undisturbed years to find an audience, you can build, at most, a modestly sized and modestly profitable advertising-supported media company with no clear path to further growth, in a chronically uncertain industry. News for a time was a respectable, and respected, bit of polish, subsidized by everything else. <b>Now that price is too high.</b><br>

  <p>Interrogam-se de caminhos menos do óbvio. A dar-lhes tempo.</div>
  <p>Regressando ao apocalipse e fim de caminhos,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Built on the expectation of fast growth in advertising sales, companies like BuzzFeed and Vox Media have instead found that Facebook and Google – “the duopoly” – have simply tightened their grip on digital advertising revenue. Revenue-per-click, the business strategy that has informed digital publishers for years, was effectively pronounced DOA this week as leading players in a sector once viewed as the future of journalism announced deep cuts. The job losses followed sales or cuts at Mic, Refinery29 and elsewhere. But publishing as a whole had already shrunk sharply. By some estimates the shift to digital has resulted in an overall reduction in the business of 50% to 80%.<br>
