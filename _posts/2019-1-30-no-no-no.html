  <p>Uma nota discordante sobre uma nota discordante, um antagonismo que nos consegue no título <em>alone.</em> Subida do preço quando o formato está de saída? Uma estratégia desesperada de queimar o que há no oposto de  acreditar que esse possa perdurar.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Once print advertising collapsed, newspapers hiked prices to get more money from readers. </b>These price hikes weren’t accidents - they were part of a conscious strategy on the part of newspapers. Newspapers had always been priced more cheaply than they cost to produce, because advertisers were the ones really paying the bills. Advertisers wanted to get their messages in front of lots of people, so newspapers priced themselves low to maintain a mass audience. When print advertising collapsed publishers realized (a) they’d need to get relatively more money from readers and (b) that those people who were still subscribing to a daily newspaper in the digital era were actually pretty devoted to it. They’d stick around at a higher price point.<br>

  <p>Dessa devoção voltaremos ao universo <b>DC</b>-ó-<b>Marvel</b> <em>et al</em> em peregrinação semanal ao quarto dia.

  <blockquote>
    <p>The analysis documented industry-wide, more-than-substantial price hikes. Seven-day home delivery price more than doubled, and weekday single-copy price tripled. Despite the increase in price, about two-thirds of print readers remained loyal to a product that has become much more expensive and is considered dying by many.</p>
    <p>Chyi has argued in many papers that the perception that print is in serious decline is both false and self-inflicted — that is, if media types would just stop saying print is dying, it wouldn’t be. The pessimistic view about print influenced the industry’s digital transformation strategy, contributed to the &quot;anti-print, pro-digital&quot; discourse, and most importantly resulted in the continued disinvestments in the print operation. </p>
    <p>But both history and their own data don’t match up with that. Newspapers raised prices after ad revenues collapsed — they didn’t &quot;turn away&quot; from ad revenue, ad revenue turned away from them.Print newspaper circulation has been steadily declining on a per-capita basis since World War II — more than 70 years. First, TV took a huge chunk of Americans’ attention, then the web did, then our phones did. Newspapers’ troubles are less about readers finding new alternatives — though obviously that doesn’t help! — and much more about advertisers finding new alternatives. <br>

    <p>The problem is they’re not making more print newspaper readers. Yes, a lot of people who have been reading print newspapers for the past 50 years want to continue to do so. No, lowering print prices to 2008 levels would not suddenly make 23-year-olds put down their phones.<br>

    <p>Having the data in one place makes it clear how deeply irrational some of these prices can seem when put in comparison with one another. Pricing is a bit of a black box, of course, a mixture of actual costs, market strategy, and owner greed.<br>
