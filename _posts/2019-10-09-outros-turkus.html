      <p>In 2017, I outsourced the commission of a book  to the resources of an online labor market. In Harvested, a selected group of  microworkers was asked to filter a huge database of JPG screenshots of adult  films according to a consciously vague instruction: whether or not they  displayed contemporary art. From 2016, I have been working on PmS involving the  re-make of Peanuts.</p>

    <p> PmS is a conceptual comic book project that  consists in the reproduction of Schulz&rsquo;s work by commissioned artists, using  digital tools and mediated by a digital labor management platform (<b>an  extremely deskilled workforce</b>) calling into question the primacy of storytelling  and drawing as the defining factors of the image-text medium.</p>

  <p>Dois eixos para complicar aqui: <em>free labor </em>e cócó. Começando pelo  fim, os <b>Conceptual Comics (CoCo).</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am interested in the unexpected ways the  comics industry&rsquo;s generative forces inherent to distributed and specialized  working routines are being reshaped in the age of digital networking. What  happens to the comics industry in the advent of media convergence and its  auxiliary operations of rapid digitization, immediacy of consumption and  broadband distribution? How the diversification of access to content  contributes to &lsquo;ever more complex relations between top-down corporate media  and bottom-up participatory culture&rsquo;? And finally, how artistic practices and  discourses, as well as the historically contingent roles that constitute the  publishing world, position themselves vis-a-vis these powerful new  environments? I came up with the term conceptual comics (CoCo) to point to the  works that thematize the industrial aspects of their medium. They can be thought as post-digital declinations  of older industrial forms of production: <b>CoCos distance themselves from works  that celebrate artistic expression or champion unique artistic and storytelling  skills. They are equally critical of the various deployments of craftsmanship  in their fabrication</b>, from the fashionable risograph to the fetishized  woodblock printing. Far from being originary acts, <b>CoCos are immersed in (and  survive from) information-intensive contexts</b>. Their singularity is an access to  otherness and their endurance originates from the way they are persistently  unraveling and reshaped. Semantically elastic, stretched by a growing web of  cross-references, often to the point of unrecognizability, <b>a CoCo work cannot  and will not remain forever the same object</b>.</p>

  <p><em>Artsy! </em>A avançar com cuidado e mantendo as distâncias…</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Artistic practice as an embodied skill is  intimately involved with conceptualization. This practice-based research paper  takes as a starting point the concept of distance: the distance I am more  interested in, is epistemological - <b>distant reading</b>. Distant reading  evades a direct confrontation with the text and can materialize &lsquo;as a synthetic  activity that takes as its raw material the &quot;readings&quot; of others&rsquo;.<b> It&rsquo;s the  &lsquo;readings of others&rsquo; that I am proposing to explore here</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> …mas vcs sabem que gostamos de reler as leituras dos outros  quando nos servem mais propósitos que os intencionados. Demasiados tópicos para  resumir: atiramos todos ao monte porque não vos estamos a escrever as vossas  teses!, só as nossas. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Free labor occupies a central position in the  digital economies and the digital labor market can now be in antagonistic  relationship with the comics industry&rsquo;s various reading communities, small  businesses and publishers.</b> What are the challenges for the increasingly networked comics industry  in times where cognitive labor deploys in postindustrial regimes of work  management and, more importantly, how artists and readers can still defend  fixed subject positions in <b>a constantly shifting world that increasingly  questions the validity of such conventions and practices</b>?</p>
    <p> Comics, for the most part, is <b>an industrial  form of art</b> that counts on the orchestrated work of different professionals  hired on a freelance basis. Its manufacturing processes depend on divisions of  labor, where fragmentation, repeatability, homogeneity, and domination are  essential features of any sequential industrial process. The production belt of  mainstream comics often involves dozens of people handling specialized roles,  making the comic book business &lsquo;a shoddy, ephemeral diversion, a form of  anonymous, relatively diluted, and industrialized pabulum&rsquo;, printers, binders,  advertisers and marketing specialists, all the way to distribution services,  newsstand vendors, retailers, journalists, etc. <b>Obviously digital technologies will not destroy  comics as we know them, but they may change their underlying decorum</b>. These changes have continuously  shaped the lives of the industry&rsquo;s amateurs and semi-professionals, who have to  organize their time around a bricolage of fragmented schedules and poorly paid  work, a Patreon account, selling a print in Deviantart, etc, are some of the  patchwork tasks of the comics networked precariat in the age of  semio-capitalism.</p>
    <p> <b>Comics are by default a multimodal text  construction, that does not fit the narrow auteurist vision of humanities and  literary scholarship.</b> Comics production is riddled with the formal subjectivities and the conflicting  personal interests and ambitions of several operators distributed throughout  the chain of signification-production. The comics industry depends on a variety of  social formats of engagement, most of which are <b>hardly recognized as labor</b>.  Through readers&rsquo; columns, corporate-led fan-clubs, alternative conventions,  mimeographed zines, specialized fora, price guides and academic conferences,  readers and fans have occupied a constitutive part of the comics industry. To  some considerable degree, their activities opened doorways favoring the  emergence of <b>new forms of content</b> that has expanded beyond the formal  loci and the traditional time schedules to encompass other forms of  self-exploited labor. The Internet, as a site of disintermediation, contributed  in not only reducing the distance between producers and consumers but also  provided the backdrop for a flexible, collective intelligence to organize these  new forms of <b><em>playbor</em></b> (activities that fit neither traditional  definitions of work nor play). The Internet has contributed to the  incentivization of the individuals that take an active role in discussing and  distributing alternative, transformational or derivative works (enabling  average consumers to archive, appropriate, annotate and recirculate media  content) <span class="voice">[but]</span> these secondary works largely depend for the valorization on the  power/knowledge nexus put forward by the mainstream comics publishers, &lsquo;a  negotiated version of the dominant culture&rsquo;s values that the working-class has  appropriated as an alternate moral system permitting legitimization of their  means of expression&rsquo; (&quot;the winning space&quot; <b>Geoff Stahl</b> <sup>1999</sup>). Comics fandom reveals the potential of an art  form, whose language-like modus operandi, dismisses claims of clear-cut roles  in the production chain and passionately argue for the importance of an  idiosyncratic &lsquo;reader&rsquo;s space&rsquo; beyond imposed meanings coming from the author or  the prevailing readings of certain works. A variety of appropriation practices  has structured the winning space - for example &lsquo;intentional communication&rsquo;  (<b>Hebdige</b> <sup>1979</sup>) or &lsquo;bricolage&rsquo; (<b>Levi-Strauss</b> <sup>1966</sup>). Lately, however,  &lsquo;détournement&rsquo;, a concept coming from the Situationists, has been particularly  helpful to understand appropriation practices in comics. It describes the  process of <b>repurposing works through the reuse of preexisting artistic  elements in a new ensemble in order to subvert the conventional discourses  produced with, and around, these works</b>. These works highlight the  insufficiency of the entrenched roles of production, claiming instead for an  expanded agency: the collapsing of the reader, the writer, the critic, the  historian, the distributor and the archivist.</p>

  <p> Opâ opâ!, punx aterrados no meio de  frentes que nos são próximas, como a revolução  digital e indústria do <em>publishing, </em>a <em>vanguarda do capitalismo.</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>The understanding of publishing as abstracted  from its technological affordance is a rhetorical, ahistorical simplification.</b> Publishing can be described as a  hybrid object-human networked activity that develops around compound  technologies of inscription and activates an entanglement of legal,  institutional, economic, political and personal bodies. Through a series of  industrial innovations and various modes of production routine optimizations,  that have also benefited other segments of the creative industry, <b>the  publishing world has always been in the vanguard of capitalism.</b> Through the  book market, it has contributed in the shaping of intellectual property  regimes, helped foreshadow the significance of cognitive labor (and its demise)  and has been an active and often disruptive force in regards to government  censorship, labor and union organizations, as well as the copyright  establishment and the application of copyright and patent laws. While  pioneering markets and professions, from web retail to tracking, monitoring and  archiving technologies, <b>the publishing industry has been able to reinvent  itself by setting aside and overruling an array of professionals that once were  key agents of the industry</b>.</p>

<p>E assim  chegados ao <em>twist </em>do<em> twist: </em>quando <em>artsy</em> e <em>luddites</em> andam de mãos dadas.<b><u></u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> PmS explores a set of operation such as  web-scraping, indexation, scripting, database building, moderation and spam  filtering <span class="voice">&amp;</span> acknowledges therefore the matter-of-factness of the available  technological tools not in terms of a reified glorification based on questions  of progress or innovation. Rather as an acceleration of the dissolution of  industry&rsquo;s entrenched roles and their old-fashioned values of artistic  integrity. The point is to document how comics reflect the  massive shifts that occur in the reconfiguration of labor for a globally,  interconnected precariat of comics artists and readers alike. What are the soft  forms of disruptive innovation that have shaped the comics industry? <b>Through  the use of new interfaces of labor management, automation, machine learning,  library digitization digital comics are shaking existing readerships, markets,  and technologies. They ultimately contribute to the formation of a new reader&rsquo;s  sensibility and (anti) authorial ethos.</b> The reconfiguration of global  production logistics related to printing, distribution and communication force  a radical realignment for the practitioners&rsquo; artistic ethos and whatever  privileged terrain of craftsmanship and outdated notions of authorial genius  and artistic exception has been left intact.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>At best</b>, PmS buys into the fashionable paradigm of  artist-as-entrepreneur and artistic work-as-content management. <b>At worst</b>,  it highlights the historically industrial properties of the medium.  Microworking as a compositional practice highlights disconcerting aspects of  the publishing industry and conjures images of sweatshop production chain,  industrial automation, unskilled labor and regimes of just-in-time production  modes. Nonetheless, <b>a closer look reveals just the opposite: the digital,  aggregated micro-actions resist the smooth integration and style uniformization  conventionally required in the industry of comics that leads to a totalizing system</b>.  Rather the opposite<b>: these submissions radically reconfigure the assumptions  made about the individual role different agents can have in a production chain.  They underline the very nature of comics as an eternal score subjected to  vagaries and contextual instantiations</b>.</p>
