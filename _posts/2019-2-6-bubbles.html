  <p>Uma realidade que nos é estranha, ninguém por cá ouve falar de livrarias a fechar porque bolhas imobiliárias as apertam num negócio já de si apertado - <em>and that's a joke, folks!</em> Mas de como a renda condiciona o formato da BD para outro dia, hoje só as notas para um <em>slice of life</em> em janeiro de 2019 para arquivo.</p>

    <p>The comic book shop was one of the last of its kind, a dusty, idiosyncratic leftover from the old street, when it was still part and production of the counterculture. But there is little counterculture left in the broken East Village. A century of rebelliousness down the drain.<br>

  <p>Exemplo 2: afastamos-nos da costa e a meio da américa encontramos (uma das) <em>Mile High Comics, </em>Colorado Blvd, e mais saldos de fim de loja:</p>

  <p>Uma outra loja a 18 meses de terminar a sua renda.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That store has 18 months left on its lease, which gives us about a year to decide its fate. I am hoping that an alternative location can be found, as the $10,000+ a month in rent that we are presently being charged is far beyond the capacity of the store to bear.<br>

  <p>E nesse tópico:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As a side note I do, however, want to caution anyone so foolish as to be considering renting a store (or a house/apartment) to not make the same foolish mistake that I did in making someone else’s mortgage payments for them (via my monthly rent...) for nearly 30 years.<br>

  <p>Crises que reconhecemos de outras <em>calls</em> em outras indústrias:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I do want to urge everyone to please resolve to support their local comics retailer during 2019. The economics of selling new issues has become total madness as the cover prices of periodical comics now reach up into the $5/copy range. With comics retailers buying non-returnable (an arrangement that I helped to pioneer in the late-1970's), all the risk is upon them as regards unsold product. That worked well when cover prices were under $1, but today's high cover prices are causing crippling losses to comics retailers whenever a title sells fewer copies than expected.<br>

  <p>  ...e regressamos <a href="{{ site.url }}/2019/01/mo-money.html">aqui</a>, onde também falámos de subscrições, prática &quot;antiga&quot; nas lojas de especialidade:</p>

  <p>Finalmente terminamos de viagens na costa oeste: San Francisco,<em> home town </em>da <b>Fantagraphics</b> e igualmente apertada de bolhas. Mas apesar de algumas parecenças...:</p>
  <p>Subscrições.</p>
  <blockquote>

  <p><em>Location location location:</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Our new location has expanded the walk-in customers tenfold<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p>...ou o inventário <em>on-tha-edge:</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The industry changes focus almost weekly. Customers that love something for years can turn on a title overnight. It’s almost literally “death by a thousand paper cuts” if you don’t keep an amazingly close eye on your ordering and customers interest.<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p>...ao contrário dos dois primeiros casos uma história de abundância:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>The Bay Area is so crowded with comic stores in a relatively small area, you can easily walk to four or five other shops from my store’s front door.</b><br>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Porque há sempre outra parte da <em>industry</em> que as regras são diferentes. A continuar.
