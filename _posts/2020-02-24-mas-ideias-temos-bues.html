<blockquote>
  <p><b>Bad Idea</b> is a newly launched comics publisher with a publishing program and business model as eccentric as the name of the company. The company will release no more than one or two new series each month and will &quot;self-distribute&quot; its comics initially to only 20 handpicked retail venues.<br>

<p>E antes que descartem <em>punx-artsy</em> e afins, não: são um composto dos restos de uma editora comercial adquirida por outra maior, <em>&quot;a group of former executives and staff at <b>Valiant Entertainment</b> in the wake of its 2018 acquisition by <b>DMG Entertainment</b>&quot;</em>, publicando entre outros <b>Matt Kindt</b> e<b> Jeff Lemire</b>. Destes <em>freaks:</em></p>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> it flies in the face of conventional wisdom about all the stuff we should be doing to be successful publishing comics</div>
<blockquote>
    <p><b>The new house is experimenting with an unusual publishing model.</b> At a time when comics readership is being driven by the book format, Bad Idea will only publish in the traditional comic book periodical format — that means no collected trade paperbacks or hardcovers or original graphic novels, and no digital comics. “<b>We’re going to build fan support organically and grow our platform by word of mouth</b> with monthly comics. You will have to go to a comic shop to buy our comics each and every month. For the last 10 years its been crazy with publishers pushing more and more comics into the market; it’s exhausting. <b>We want to do more with less.</b> We’re going to focus on high-quality monthly comics, <b>treated as art objects.</b> We understand that this won’t work for every store. But we don’t need every store to make this work,” he said.<br>

<p>Nós temos alguns dizeres sobre o que <em>he said.</em> Mas antes, <em>word:</em> os últimos 20 <em>handpicked</em> <em>punx</em> devem  estar a receber zines esta semana, <em>tops.</em> Zines e <i>indies</i> e más ideias, ao contrário dos senhores acima, precisamos de zero lojas <sup>(*)</sup> para que isto funcione.</p>
