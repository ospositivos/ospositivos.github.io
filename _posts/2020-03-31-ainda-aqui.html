  <p>E de uma indústria que está sempre a voltar, não vos vamos aborrecer com resumos do apocalipse em curso nos comics dos américas: este está a ser tão bem documentado com tantas intervenções online que damos por adquirido que gerações futuras terão uma grande facilidade de encontrar material de leitura suficiente. Mas vamos pedir-vos 2 minutos para o resumo <sup class="asterisk">(*)</sup> <span class="sidenote sidenote-right">Extra em <i>cites</i> a recordar: <i>"The comic book form emerged in the 1930s as a <b>promotional giveaway</b> for department stores and gas stations before it migrated to the newsstand as a part of the larger magazine industry."</i></span> pelo <b>Bart Beaty</b>, o autor dos <i>"Comics Versus Art"</i> ou <i>"Unpopular Culture: Transforming the European Comic Book in the 1990s"</i>. Em intro:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This week, for the first time in more than 80 years, no new comic books will ship to shops, and production is on hold into the foreseeable future. Neither the Second World War nor 9/11 stopped weekly comic book distribution to comic stores. But COVID-19 means production and distribution is now on hold, and the future of comics is up in the air.<br>

  </blockquote>

<p>E de onde pegamos conversas para matutação geral:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To understand how this single decision could transform the operations of comic book publishers as well as comic production, consumption and culture, one needs to understand <b>how the status of the comic book has shifted over the past century</b>.<br>

  <p>O nosso <i>hightlight</i> às teses desse <i>shift</i> em <i>status</i> será este:</p>



<div class="info coluna">
  <blockquote>
    <p>Since 2011, most comic books have been released to comic book stores and in electronic format to consumers through platforms like Comixology (a subsidiary of Amazon) on the same day. With a protracted closure of the distribution system, publishers like Marvel and DC could continue to move forward with electronic sales, which would inevitably bolster that end of their business at the expense of their retail partners.  <b>If several months passed with electronic sales but no physical comic book sales, it’s uncertain that those printed books would ever find an audience.</b> While comic books sales proved remarkably resilient during the 2008 financial crisis, if the current situation breaks readers’ buying habits for a few months, they might never return in the same way.<br>
