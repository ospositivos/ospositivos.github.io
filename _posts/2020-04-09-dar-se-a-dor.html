    <blockquote>
        <p>The internet ought to serve as a reliable platform for sending our gifts out into in the world. Certainly there’s no more powerful tool for reaching the larger global community. In fact, I believe there is a moral imperative for each of us to do this.

    <blockquote>
        <p>But the cruel truth of the web is that the gifted contribute to the digital world (often for free) only to see their gifts quickly appropriated by others who debase everything they touch. The ruthless economic underpinnings of the internet serve to punish the giver and destroy the spiritual, disinterested essence of the gift.</p>

    <p>E segue-se <i>long mashup</i> porque a vida é curta e o essencial está todo aqui, com uma <i>ref</i> a <i>merchants</i> para fechar ciclo ao <a href="{{ site.url }}/2020/04/irritando-meerceiros.html">merceeiro</a> de uns dias atrás.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>There are web platforms built on gratuitous giving. But the real foundation of the internet is businesses that pretend to be gift exchanges. These businesses have cleverly constructed their platforms to lure the gifted into a faux gift-exchange community that is actually built on squeezing them dry and paying as little as possible for the privilege.</p>

        <p>At first, these platforms did little to harm the cultural ecosystem - at least for a short period. You’re not forced to participate in the digital age, but good luck trying to find another way to survive. The damage varies from field to field, but almost no area of creative work has emerged unscathed from this forced imposition of a gift-exchange culture by transaction-based companies. Journalists have watched as newspaper after newspaper has shut down, photographers, videographers, illustrators, and creative professionals in dozens of other fields have felt the same pinch. Creative individuals are expected to give away the very basis of their livelihood. The gifted give while others prosper.<br>

    <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> No merchant or trader, no matter how greedy, ever dared do that in the past.</div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The problem isn’t with gift exchange—a building block of all societies that underpins all our relationships of love, trust, and friendship—but with that gray zone in which transaction-driven traders pretend to operate on those values while counting every penny back in their lavish headquarters.</p>

        <p>That gray zone now encompasses almost all of our creative economy.</p>

        <p>We ought to withhold our trust. The very fact that these platforms are disguised as gift exchanges should alert us to the danger they represent. We need to be suspicious in dealing with them both because of their masquerade and also because of their monopolistic size. It’s important to remember that these corporations, for all their size and dominance, aren’t like authoritarian governments—they ultimately rely on the hundreds of millions of individuals whose active daily participation in their business models created their dominance in the first place.<br>

    <p>Sugestões / soluções:</p>

  <div class="info coluna">
   <blockquote>
        <ul class="lista">
           <li>We should make a public outcry when any business asks a creative professional to work for free. The charade of inviting artists to participate in a faux gift exchange while a web platform makes money through side deals ought to be exposed for what it is—a shameful tool of economic exploitation.</li>
           <li>Finally, we must create true gift exchanges on the web—altruistic enterprises that support the gifted individuals in our midst. The internet is a source of empowerment for all, not just for tech titans, and when used by those motivated by generosity, compassion, and fairness, it can be transformative. It can—and should—be an engine of goodwill and a source of spiritual uplift. We are fortunate that the tools are at hand to make it happen.</li>
