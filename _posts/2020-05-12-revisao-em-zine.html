    <blockquote>
        <p>Zines are most often the work of one person, usually someone who finds themselves misunderstood by a general audience, actually enjoys working alone, and yet is also welcoming like-minded souls. You dig? Alrighty then. Another thing you need to know about zines: the creator is often immersed in one particular subject or theme per zine. Zines take dedication. Zines can sometimes seem obsessive but thatâ€™s part of the charm. <br>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Zines can cover virtually any topic or subject. Literally, if thereâ€™s something youâ€™d like to discuss, then a zine could be a viable platform for you. And, yes, itâ€™s true: no prior experience in the creation of zines is required or expected. And the most serious of subjects are open for discussion. Zines are often ironic and sarcastic and have a rough and gritty aesthetic. Zines share a bit of the same vibe as spoken word with their direct and concise narrative. If you try too hard to make one, it will show. If you gravitate too quickly to the zine scene without any prior knowledge, it will showâ€“but thatâ€™s okay. <b>Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that no one owns the zine scene.</b><br>

    <p>Mas tambÃ©m estarÃ­amos em falta se nÃ£o dissÃ©ssemos aos cotas que os zines nÃ£o se ficaram pelo tempo das avozinhas. Senhores, aquilo da <i>web?</i></p>

        <p><b>Blogging and zine-making share a lot of overlap!</b> In a sense, this review, and certainly this blog, is a zine. See what I mean? You only need to go as far as the nearest desk and chair, or whatever is comparable, and try it out yourself.<br>

    <p>E como nos zines em papel, do <i>try it</i> ao <i>do it</i> pouca diferenÃ§a. ComeÃ§a um zine, dÃ¡-lhe um endereÃ§o ðŸ˜Š.</p>
