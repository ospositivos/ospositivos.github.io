        <p>In all my life, I have yet to hear of someone on their deathbed who says that they wish they would have put in longer hours at the factory or office, and I don’t think it’s too bold to state that the very concept of trading away the better part of your life — time that you can never get back — in exchange for money that you can’t take with you is an inherently raw deal regardless of income or occupation. <br>

    <p>E assim chegados à nossa nota de hoje onde combinamos humores e depressivos. Mesmo sítio, publicado hoje, repetimos <i>blurbs</i> aos zines-em-missão...:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Zine culture has been entwined with autobiography since the desktop publishing revolution of the 90s. The intimacy of the minicomics <del>object</del> it’s appealing to those who want to share and explore who they are and what life means - a means of self-expression that’s low-stakes in terms of economics and publishing, but extremely high-stakes in terms of its possibility of sparking epiphanies and acting as a therapeutic outlet.<br>

    <p>...e erguemos brinde aos que já tiveram a sua epifania <i>long-ago</i> mas condenados contra-vontade ao compasso de espera. Senhores, agora como nos noventa,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>A mini doesn’t have to tell your entire life story or even provide a sustained narrative: autobio can be a lifelong pursuit, a statement of identity, a way to explore mental health, or simply a way to engage the world.<br>
