    <p> It pulls me back to a certain time and a certain place. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for anyone. But we were all there and hip-hop was our music; and because we were adolescents it was also our conscience.<br>

  <p>Metade do que nos leem desaprovarão semelhante desinteresse por domínios paralelos: <i>french comics? really? </i>Bem, sim, às vezes. Não se importem demasiado com nacionalidades, nem o <i>french </i>hip-hop é particularmente francês, nem os comics dessas paragens têm-nos o mesmo arrasto que os seus congéneres norte-américas: hexágonos à parte, são  semelhanças com outras geometrias que justificam o excerto.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Hip-hop is an adolescent genre of music. Between the lines you can plainly see attempts to tackle critical issues: social inequality, sex, religion, mortality, boredom, fear. But, ungainly and awkward, it indulges in the most ridiculous immaturity. Still, the stupidity of adolescence is not without its rush, its exhilaration. Freshness has its place. The music of our youth is tinged with a special effervescence. It is imbued with meanings we can only barely articulate, coloured with feelings couched in half-remembered conversations, in old friends and half-forgotten crushes, stored amid all the whirring dynamos of the unconscious.</p>
    <p> Emotional immaturity doesn&rsquo;t imply historical insignificance. Hip-hop has registered and encoded this historical narrative and expressed it in a native tongue.<br>
