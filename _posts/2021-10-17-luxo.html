<p>Voltamos uma <a href="{{ site.url}}/2020/11/e-ciencia.html">terceira</a> vez aos <b><i>"Sapiens"</i></b> <sup>out 2021</sup> de <b>Yuval Noah Harari</b> et al., embora a página acima funcione mais como <i>teaser</i> do que propósito principal. Esse?, a revolução agrícola como  semente ao <i>downfall</i> da humanidade, <a href="{{ site.url }}/2021/09/civ-contra-civ.html">primeiro</a> passo à civilização que, umas quantas páginas adiante, nos recordam erguer-se sobre a miséria das massas de qualquer período histórico que escolham. Não vos pretendemos nenhuma observação da qualidade da obra, somente: conversas demasiado <a href="{{ site.url }}/2021/08/ted-talk.html">radicais</a> poucas décadas atrás são agora tema habitual na esfera pública sem ais nem uis. </p>
<p>Será da embalagem? Talvez o formato importe ao conteúdo. </p>
<p><i>Meanwhile, z-to-tha-g </i>em coincidências, acrescentos pelo autor do <b><i><a href="{{ site.url }}/2016/12/pobres-ricos-pobres-ricos.html">&quot;Bullshit Jobs&quot;</a></i></b><i>, </i>aqui na revisão de mais um livro de interesse popular:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the wake of bestselling blockbusters such as <b>Jared Diamond</b>'s Collapse and <b>Yuval Noah Harari</b>'s Sapiens, that backwater of history – prehistory – has been infused by a surge of popular interest. </p>
  <p>Since the Enlightenment, there have been two conflicting visions of humanity stripped of its civilised trappings. On the one hand, there is <b>Hobbes</b>'s notion of us as predisposed to violence – waging war against each other in a &quot;nasty, brutish and short&quot; existence. On the other, <b>Rousseau</b>'s idyll of prelapsarian innocence, in which humanity led a life of Edenic bliss before being destroyed by the corruptions of society. Of course, few modern scholars accept either Hobbes's bleak caricature or Rousseau's romantic musings.</p>
  <p>That is to say that for most of human history our ancestors lived an egalitarian and leisure-filled life in small bands of hunter-gatherers. Then, as Diamond put it, we made the &quot;worst mistake in human history&quot;, which was to increase population numbers through agricultural production. This, so the story goes, led to hierarchies, subordination, wars, disease, famines and just about every other social ill – thus did we plunge from Rousseau's heaven into Hobbes's hell. </p>
  <p>According to Graeber and Wengrow's reading of up-to-date archeological and anthropological research, that story is nonsense. On the contrary, they maintain, prehistory was a time of diverse social experimentation. Most significantly, the authors replace the idea of humanity being forced along through evolutionary stages with a picture of prehistoric communities making their own conscious decisions of how to live. Our distant forebears were not hopeless puppets of historical inevitability but masters of their own trajectory.</p>
  <p>Still, the question the authors repeatedly ask, but never quite get round to answering is, <b>how then did we become &quot;stuck&quot; in a system of hierarchies and conspicuous inequalities of power and consumption?</b><br>
