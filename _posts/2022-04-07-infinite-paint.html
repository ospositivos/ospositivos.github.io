    <p>Digital communication technologies continue to transform the  analogue arts to fit into an ever-growing online media landscape. While  much of the conversation surrounding them is centered around social  networking and media platformization, along with their effect on the  average netizen's social and creative life, web media has found itself  reshaping the way audiences interact with art ever since the earliest  days of the web. The Internet has allowed the proliferation of fully  online and digital-form media that evolved along with it and the  communities surrounding them for all of its history; and comics, more so  than any other medium, have gone hand-in-hand with the Internet since  before there was an Internet as we understand it today, in the form of  webcomics and comic strips: arguably the medium which has, historically,  been best suited to fit every iteration of the web, and every space  that sprang from it.</p>
    <p>Webcomics have evolved reflecting the ways online culture and  communities shifted over time as online spaces grew in size, audience  and complexity. Since their inception, they have provided a window into  the possibilities of web media in general. Even from an early stage,  their potential to reshape established comic narrative and design have  been at the center of the discussion surrounding them. To this day,  however, no single webcomic has managed to more completely encapsulate  the potential of digital design and presentation than the collected  works of Andrew Hussie's <em>MS Paint Adventures</em>, a sprawling group  of interactive, multimedia comics which managed to use nearly every  affordance of web media for its own unique brand of cooperative  storytelling and quirky storytelling.</p>
    <p>To understand the way webcomics can break away from the traditional  mold of comics, it's important to look at the history of the medium, and  how its growth was informed by the growing audiences and communities  surrounding and sustaining them.</p>
    <p>One of the problematic aspects of looking at webcomics from a  historical perspective is the lack of writing and archiving of their  history and academia as a medium; leading to much of webcomics' history  existing as hearsay and anecdote, with few sources attempting to craft  timelines of the medium. For instance, Shaenon Garrity's (2011) essay <a href="https://www.tcj.com/the-history-of-webcomics/">The History of Webcomics</a>, published for the online edition of <em>The Comics Journal</em>,  outlined a timeline of major webcomics and trends in the medium since  their inception in the mid-'80s and onwards into the present. Some years  later, Sean Kleefeld's (2020) book <em>Webcomics</em> did much of the same work within its first few chapters.</p>
    <p>Garrity and Kleefeld both drafted a timeline from the very early  online comics of the '80s and '90s pre-web era of the internet through  to web-hosted comics and professional cartoonists making the shift from  print to online publication roughly around the same time as the dotcom  bubble of the late '90s, and from there into the present. According to  Garrity's research, the earliest webcomics were hosted in bulletin  boards, e-mail mailing lists and Usenet groups, some of which remain  difficult to locate and archive to this day. Kleefeld's timeline mirrors  Garrity's, though he addresses the way in which most of the early  history of the medium is apocryphal - the earliest webcomics were mostly  passed around in groups of tech enthusiasts or academics, and mostly  discussed in a manner similar to newspaper strips. Because of this,  along with the non-existence of web hosting in the early days of the  Internet and a general lack of archiving of the early web, many  assertions about the earliest webcomics remain fuzzy at best and highly  unlikely at worst, as Kleefeld points out using the commonly held belief  that a comic strip named <em>Witches and Stitches</em> was the "first" webcomic, despite no evidence of its existence remaining available anywhere online.</p>
    <p>Some of the earliest professional artists to dip their toes into  online distribution were established comic strip cartoonists such as  Bill Holbrook and Scott Adams, in the latter half of the 1990s. Comics  covering a wider range of topics and genres also started to emerge  around that time, and web cartoonists started to experiment with the  format and presentation of the comics themselves. Garrity herself refers  to this period between 1996 and 2000 as a "singularity" of sorts, as  the medium was infused with a renewed creative energy from the many  writers and artists taking an interest in web publication. It's around  the year 2000 that the popularity of webcomics begins to massively boom,  as internet adoption becomes more widespread. Specific genres of comics  also become more prevalent; video game, fantasy and science fiction  webcomics start to become the most popular around this time. Jerry  Holkins' and Mike Krahulik's <em>Penny Arcade</em> (figure 01), which  began publication in the late 1990s and continues to this day, is one  commonly cited example of a webcomic that caught the early wave of  attention towards the medium by the growing online population at the  turn of the millennium.</p>

    <p>An aspect of <em>Penny Arcade</em>'s ongoing success that hasn't been  explored in much detail is how it also provides a good example of  successful community building through its long-running forums.  Webcomics, perhaps by design, rely almost entirely on building strong  communities of fans to keep traffic flowing. However, online community  building isn't just exclusive to the audience, as online creative spaces  began allowing for the creators and writers themselves to form their  own creative communities over time. In her article,<em> A Historical Approach to Webcomics: Digital Authorship in the Early 2000s</em>, Leah Misemer (2019) discusses a specific mock-feud between the creators of two major webcomics, <em>Questionable Content</em> and <em>Sam and Fuzzy</em>, as a way of exploring the creative environment in webcomics at the time.</p>
    <p>At that time, web search results were indexed based on external links  to a site. Thus, by serving links to each other's websites, both  authors provided slight bumps in search engine results for their comics,  potentially bringing in more readers. Misemer argues that this shows  the development of a culture of cooperative competition between web  cartoonists, in which it becomes common practice to boost the visibility  of fellow authors. From a creative standpoint, this means that artists  and writers began forming communities both within and without their  audiences over time, as well as with each other. Webcomics like the  aforementioned <em>Questionable Content</em> or <em>Penny Arcade</em> would host forums for users to discuss topics related to the comics or  other media, keeping users engaged and spending time in the site without  having to create new content. These sorts of communities, however, did  influence the comics they formed around.</p>
    <p>Another effect of this community building is that it gave authors a  direct line of communication to their audience and vice versa, thus  allowing for the writers to drop in and casually discuss their comics  with readers, who, in turn, would end up influencing the comics either  directly by suggesting topics to cover or jokes, or indirectly through  discussion.</p>
    <p>From here we can glean that community, audience interaction and the  immediacy of online social spaces lead to a more diverse creative  environment, where authors are able to use not just their voices in  their stories, but those of their audience and fellow creators,  fostering an environment of creative cooperation and competition. This,  however, is all related to context around the comics themselves, rather  than their content, format and presentation. While community building  may be a central aspect to how webcomics are written and how they grow  their audience, it's the way they're presented and how they use  web-based technologies that really sets them apart from their print  counterparts.</p>
    <p>What appears to be the first academic text discussing webcomics as a  unique medium separate to print is Scott McCloud's (2000) book <em>Reinventing Comics</em>, a follow-up to his previous <em>Understanding Comics </em>(both  of which are presented as long-form comic books), in which he goes on  to discuss the evolution of comics, multiple revolutions happening  within and without the industry, and finally culminating in the  development of the digital comic separate from the print format.</p>
    <p>In the final chapter of the book, McCloud looks back upon the  relationship between home computers and comics, and how the changes in  technology bent the then rigid definitions of "comic" that he had been  working with previously. The thing that separates the comic from other  forms of media is the artist and reader's agency in the progression of  time in the narrative, where panel arrangement and composition turns the  comic page into a "temporal map", time in motion through snapshots of  movement. The problem is that up until that point, comics were bound by  the standard print page format, which invariably breaks the flow of time  and movement within the page, limiting the author's use of this  temporal map and creating conventions in panel distribution and layout  that comics follow, and an artist's available set of tools by proxy.  McCloud argues that, at the time of writing, online technology had the  potential to "free" the artist from the boundaries of the page, allowing  them to work on what he dubs an "infinite canvas", an endless expanse  of non-physical space in which to place panels and display actions in  time.</p>
    <p>Unbound by the page, McCloud posits that comics could take on any  form an artist can imagine, the only limitation being the technology of  the time. Bandwidth in the pre-broadband era of home Internet was too  low to transmit large images and screen resolutions too small to display  them, and the HTML programming language didn't allow for a zoom and pan  functionality, creating many of the same limitations as the page space  would. He also makes mention of comics and graphic novels such as Art  Spiegelman's <em>Maus</em> which briefly experimented with distribution  on CD-ROM. What is interesting about these CD Comics is the amount of  multimedia material they included – <em>Maus</em>, for instance,  included photos and videos as supplementary material, similar to how DVD  movies would include bonus features a decade later.</p>
    <p>McCloud's argument calls upon the use of web tools such as hypertext  and embedded multimedia to not just compliment and accompany the comic,  but become a part of it just as ink and paper are. He uses all of this  to make a call to action for future comic creators in the digital  environment to make full use of the multimedia tools inherent to the  online environment and reinvent comics in a way that's unique to the  digital tools now available – calling a joining of comics and  interactivity a necessity in its evolution. Interactivity, in all its  forms, would become pivotal to the development of webcomics at the turn  of the millennium.</p>
    <p>Interactive comics have their roots in the mid '90s. McCloud,  Kleefeld and Garrity all cite one of the earliest examples of an  interactive comic as 1995's <em>Argon Zark!</em>, created by cartoonist Charley Parker. Though primitive, <em>Argon Zark!</em> showed design choices and sensibilities unique to the web medium that  were ahead of its time, due in part to Parker's background in web design  giving him a more complete knowledge of web development. However, as  McCloud points out, it remained constrained in the regular page layout  of a print comic, following the habitual left-to-right-top-to-bottom  page layout of print media. <em>Argon Zark!</em>'s biggest innovation,  however, was in the use of interactive Flash Player elements it would  occasionally pepper its strips with. This would prove to be one of the  earliest uses of multimodality as part of the storytelling of a  comic—the use of multiple modes of communication in conjunction with one  another, rather than separately. In this case, visual, aural and  kinetic.</p>

    <p>Garrity brings up Jesse Reklaw's <em>Slow Wave</em> as another key  text in the rise of interactive comics, a surrealist comic strip with a  simple twist: all the comics were dreams readers had e-mailed Reklaw.  What we must focus on here is the idea of interactivity and multimodal  presentation. Together, <em>Argon Zark!</em> and <em>Slow Wave </em>show  two modes of communication that are uniquely suited to the webcomic:  the picture in motion and reader interaction, which together could  create a dynamic, reader-driven narrative. Following from McCloud's  earlier example, the CD edition of <em>Maus</em> and CD games of the  early '90s also give us a glimpse of another mode of communication that  webcomics may take advantage of: multimedia presentation.</p>
    <p>It is not out of the realm of possibility that print comics may include supplementary material or reader input; the concept of <em>Slow Wave</em> was done via letters to a newspaper cartoonist. The key here is the  immediacy of such interactions. With e-mail or web forums, writers could  receive feedback from readers near instantaneously, rather than in  however long it might take to deliver mail. Similarly, with multimedia  web design, comics could integrate music and even fully interactive  segments seamlessly into their narrative. McCloud argues that many of  the features that he at the time had envisioned were not possible in the  HTML language, but makes a note of the potential for the then-nascent  Flash and Java programming languages. This prediction would turn out to  be completely correct, as both Flash and later JavaScript would become  the cornerstone of Web 2.0, and in turn the foundation for what's  arguably the best realized example of McCloud's vision for webcomics so  far, <em>MS Paint Adventures</em>.</p>
    <p><em>MS Paint Adventures</em> was a website in which writer and artist Andrew Hussie hosted four of their comics, <em>Jailbreak</em>, <em>Bardquest</em>, <em>Problem Sleuth</em> and <em>Homestuck</em>. Prior to this, Hussie hosted all of their work on their personal site before transitioning its forums to the new <em>MS Paint Adventures</em> site. In 2018, <em>MS Paint Adventures</em> was renamed <em>Homestuck.com</em>,  and revamped to focus on the last of the four comics, which was both  the most popular and longest running at over 8,000 pages, following  Hussie's sale of all <em>MS Paint Adventures</em> properties to publisher VIZ Media. VIZ would take over operation of the site, changing the layout and focusing it primarily on <em>Homestuck</em>,  while allowing readers to browse the previous stories. Hussie's earlier  work includes a few traditional comics intended for print publication,  as well as other webcomics and comic strips.</p>
    <p>By 2008, Hussie was already an accomplished independent writer and  artist, and if one looks at their work intended for print, their  artistic sensibilities felt almost constrained by the page. Hussie's art  style generally disregarded standard panel composition in favor of  letting pictures in the pages flow into one another, having each page  show more of a complete picture than a series of smaller images. Hussie  had a habit of pushing the boundaries of their figures while keeping  everything in the page visually clear, creating dynamic images that  flowed into one another as the story's pace dictated.</p>
    <p>Though prolific, Hussie shows a habit of letting their work disappear  - the only reason most of their earlier comics can still be read is  thanks to Hussie's fans creating backups and archives hosted  independently. Even <em>Homestuck</em>, these days, is best read through  a fan-made reader application on the desktop, due to how VIZ has failed  to maintain and update the site's Flash-based architecture, rendering  sections entirely unreadable. Regardless of all this, the origin of <em>MS Paint Adventures</em> can be traced back to Hussie's own forums tied to their earlier webcomics. Hussie themself confirmed this in <a href="https://wheals.github.io/interviews/stanford.html">an interview</a> with Elijah Meeks (2010) for the blog <em>Digital Humanities Specialist</em>, hosted by Stanford University, discussing the design process behind <em>Homestuck</em>.</p>
    <p>In the interview, Hussie explains how the website began as a game on  their forum, which they later spun off into a larger project. The way it  worked was simple, Hussie gave "players", fellow forum posters, a  scenario, and readers would suggest "commands" that Hussie would then  draw out and describe, as a sort of mix between a tabletop roleplaying  game and computer text-based adventure game. This was not a new  concept—roleplaying games such as this one are common in most online  forums even to this day. Hussie themself admits to be certain they  probably did not come up with the concept, and someone had to have done  it before. The difference here is that Hussie would later use these  forum games as a storytelling engine for their later work.</p>
    <p>The first two "games", <em>Jailbreak</em> and <em>Bardquest</em>,  consisted of Hussie mostly just acting as a sort of Game Master for  their forum, drawing out commands as they were input. Both were archived  in the <em>MS Paint Adventures </em>site once it launched. Even at this early stage, narratives quickly grow in complexity. <em>Jailbreak</em> was a series of commands in which a character attempts to escape from a  jail cell, totaling 134 pages separated by individual commands. Though <em>Bardquest</em> was much shorter, it experimented with branching paths that players  could take, reaching 47 pages with several commands per page, allowing  the reader to go back after reaching a "Game Over" screen.</p>
    <p><em>Problem Sleuth</em>, Hussie's third comic, was intended to be  more complex than its predecessors. The comic follows three detectives  in a parody of the noir genre, and quickly shifts into a mix of fantasy  and absurdist comedy. The story is presented in the style of a computer  adventure game, to the extent of characters having inventories separate  from one another to use in commands. Like the previous two games,  readers would suggest commands which Hussie would then pick from and  draw. Readership grew, giving Hussie more options to choose from before  moving the story forward. Unlike the previous games, Hussie had  allegedly planned story elements in advance, rather than writing off the  cuff, leaning more into the format of running a collective game in  which readers played the role of all the characters at once.</p>
    <p>Hussie describes the relationship to their readers as a sort of cat  and mouse game, where a lot of the comedy came from a narrative of tug  of war between established plans for the story and commands that players  would input. Hussie reiterates this in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/10/29/homestuck-creator-explains-how-his-webcomic-became-phenomenon/">another interview</a> with Michael Cavna (2018) for<em> The Washington Post</em>, elaborating on how a simple scenario in <em>Problem Sleuth</em> might move into more complex and fantastical story developments,  bringing up time travel, theoretical physics and recursive references to  video game logic. This sense of gratuitous escalation of complexity  would later become a staple of the site as a whole, along with Hussie's  writing.</p>
    <p><em>Problem Sleuth</em> would also introduce a new element to the  presentation, in the form of animation (figure 03). Occasionally, and  more commonly as it went on, panels are presented as animated .gif files  of varying complexity. Some of these only do so for backgrounds or  slight movement, while other panels would use these animations to  display more complex actions, such as beats in a fight scene or objects  moving within the frame. The overall intent is to make the comic move at  the pace of an old computer video game, where actions only progress  following player input, and animations loop if left undisturbed - giving  the visual effect of time being frozen in motion. Once again - much  like a temporal map made up of snapshots of movement.</p>

    <p>By this point, <em>Problem Sleuth</em> used all of the elements of its predecessors to tell a complete story, using the visual style of <em>Bardquest</em> and <em>Jailbreak</em> combined with limited animation and constant shifts in art style while  remaining visually consistent, shifting as the story or specific jokes  demanded. <em>Problem Sleuth</em> would continue for 1,600 pages and 22 chapters, written through reader input from start to finish. What <em>Problem Sleuth</em> had managed to accomplish was taking the collaborative game-writing  formula of its predecessors and applying it to a rough narrative plan,  while using the affordances of web media to enhance the reading  experience, drawing readers in. Combined with Hussie's own eclectic  artistic sensibilities, these elements give <em>Problem Sleuth</em> a  unique personality and style that set it apart from its contemporaries  or even successors. Hussie would take the lessons in design from <em>Problem Sleuth</em> and further refine them in its follow-up, <em>Homestuck</em>,  which would take the formula established by it and add in everything  from fully animated chapters, interactive game segments, and 20 music  albums, with greater community influence and involvement; yet,  paradoxically, written without direct reader participation.</p>
    <p><em>Homestuck</em> is the last comic produced for <em>MS Paint Adventures, </em>running intermittently from April 13th, 2008, through April 13th, 2016. Like <em>Problem Sleuth</em> before it, <em>Homestuck</em> began as an interactive story, having readers suggest commands for  characters to follow in the same way as its predecessors. Like <em>Problem Sleuth</em>, several elements of <em>Homestuck</em>'s  story were planned in advance. After the first year and four chapters  of constant publication, Hussie would cease taking commands directly  from readers, but kept the command format for individual pages, as it  had become a stylistic trademark of the site. That is not to say that  the comic had no further input from readers, as readers in the <em>MS Paint Adventures</em> forum named most characters, and the comic would gain a great deal of  social media fame, which Hussie also reacted to directly within the  story.</p>
    <p><em>Homestuck</em> increased the complexity of its story while adding new formats of presentation as it went on. Where <em>Problem Sleuth</em> had experimented with the use of animated panels, <em>Homestuck</em> would feature them as well, as well as fully animated Flash videos,  complete with music. The music for the comic was produced by other forum  members and friends of Hussie's, such as now-famous video game  developer and music composer Toby Fox, of <em>Undertale</em> fame, who  provided a sizable amount of the music for the entire run of the comic,  along with contributions in art and writing. Many of the style  sensibilities that made <em>Undertale</em> an indie darling are visible in <em>Homestuck</em>, making it an interesting companion piece.</p>

    <p>Also following in the footsteps of its predecessor, the plot of <em>Homestuck</em> begins with a simple setup that grows into an infamous degree of  self-referential complexity and narrative density. The initial premise  of four children playing an online video game that alters reality around  them quickly grows into a coming-of-age epic touching on the themes of  survival, predestination, nihilism, time travel, and obscure movie  references; chapters in the story (titled "Acts") grow exponentially  longer, giving the comic a degree of infamy due to its sheer length. To  this day, online discussions on the comic remark on its gargantuan  length first, and content second.</p>
    <p>The comic doubles down on the adventure game format by having video  game abstractions such as inventory management being real narrative  devices used to advance the plot on several occasions, with a running  gag of characters spending untold amounts of time learning to use their  inventory only to rarely bring it up again. User interface elements such  as menu systems and standard icons accompany these segments, making the  comic look much closer to a video game in visual design than its  predecessor. Part of this has to do with the readers playing along as  they read; though new readers tend to complain about the slow pace of  early chapters caused by readers playing around with the in-story game  mechanics for dozens of pages at a time, this in a way contributes to  the framing of the story as a world running on video-game logic, as  players will often find themselves fiddling with game mechanics and  inventory systems for hours at a time when first learning a game.</p>

    <p>The biggest addition to the page design is the dialogue's  presentation in the story. Because characters begin the story talking to  each other through a chat client exclusively, the comic portrays  dialogue through "pesterlogs" - chat logs in which characters are  identified by the color of their text, abbreviated handle, and  distinctive typing styles, emulating the appearance of chat clients such  as AIM [AOL Instant Messenger] or IRC [Internet Relay Chat]. These chat  logs would become one of the standard design features of the comic, to  the point that its spinoffs would continue to use the design despite it  not having the in-story justification of characters speaking through  instant messages. This form of dialogue presentation is not done just  for the sake of aesthetics, as it is used as a way to communicate each  characters' personalities to the audience, even before they are properly  introduced. Character typing quirks, such as their use of punctuation,  spelling and grammar and other stylistic choices, are used to give the  audience a better idea of the characters' voices and personalities  before and after they're formally introduced or even named.</p>

    <p>This helps humanize the cast, as the typing styles reflect the way  people talk over the Internet. Hussie uses these small elements of  visual design in order to both inform characterization and advance the  narrative, as well as endear the characters to the readers quickly and  effectively by tapping into the intended audience's experiences in  online environments. This particular design choice shows an innate  understanding of online social dynamics of the time, and makes <em>Homestuck</em> a time capsule of pre-social media online etiquette (and/or lack  thereof). Later on, this same writing quirk is used as a form of  worldbuilding for different alien societies in the universe of the  comic.</p>
    <p>As stated earlier, animation is also present throughout the story to a much greater degree than in <em>Problem Sleuth</em>.  Most panels are composed of .gif files showing looping animations, in  the same style as its predecessor, whereas still panels are the  exception. Flash animated sequences were initially reserved for  important events, like the end of an act, but become much more common  later on. Hussie admits in both aforementioned interviews that they were  the most difficult part of the entire endeavor. Besides tweening-based  animation, full digital animation and even live action claymation are  used in places during the story. Animation styles varied, earlier taking  the appearance of slideshows and limited sprite animation, shifting  between the comic's usual artstyle and more detailed styles as the  action progressed, using motion tweening rather than animating character  movement by hand. Later on, fans would contribute art for these  animations, and the last chapter of the story, <em>Act 7</em>, was entirely animated by fans of the comic.</p>
    <p>Over time, Hussie would experiment with interactive animations and  split paths merging back into the main narrative. Early on, some Flash  pages would show small game-like animations that readers could interact  with, such as the main characters having combat encounters in the style  of a role playing game, giving the reader options that would play out  different animations before moving on to the next panel. Hussie would  later integrate completely interactive segments where readers would take  on the role of one or more characters, walking around talking to other  characters and solving puzzles, adopting a visual style reminiscent of  multiple 16-bit video games of the 1990s, which make up a good amount of  the comic's pop cultural reference pool.</p>
    <p>Though the readers take on the role of the characters in many places, a running gag carried over from <em>Problem Sleuth</em> involves the readers themselves being a character in the story, as well  as Hussie, who exists in the periphery of the narrative, literally  writing and drawing the comic from within its world. Meta-narrative  jokes such as this would make up a majority of the humor in <em>Homestuck</em>,  adding to its already daunting narrative complexity. By the end of the  story, most of the final chapters are dedicated to closing complex time  loops and relationships of causality between them, with the actual end  of the story being explained a few hundred pages before the story would  conclude. Just like <em>Problem Sleuth</em> before it, <em>Homestuck</em> would use any chance it got to make the narrative more convoluted, up  to a point where the main character travels through the narrative of the  comic itself to affect continuity retroactively, in doing so doubling  the size of the still-living cast, almost as an acknowledgement of the  comic's infamous amount of characters. With all that, the comic would  last over 8,000 pages, 15,000 panels and, by some counts, four hours of  animation by the time it was finished, making it one of the longest  works of fiction in the English language by word count alone. This level  of density became its defining feature to outsiders, as well as a point  of pride for its readers.</p>
    <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLK7RI_HW-E">a short video essay</a> for the PBS's <em>Idea Channel</em> hosted on YouTube, Mike Rugnetta (2012) proposes a comparison between <em>Homestuck</em> and James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>,  along with other works with a similar reputation as impenetrably dense,  arguing that the overwhelming complexity and self-referential  textuality of both works is what draws readers in, while also providing a  sense of effort justification to those who stick with it. He was not  alone in making said comparison, as the aforementioned <em>Washington Post</em> interview also opens with that analogy, and many others would use <em>Ulysses</em> as a point of comparison to explain the appeal and difficulty of the  work. Rugnetta also makes a passing mention of the comic's popularity,  referencing the online joke about <em>Homestuck</em> cosplayers  populating conventions at the comic's peak in readership. The comic  gained a reputation for its sizable fanbase being near inescapable in  social media in the early 2010s.</p>
    <p>With popularity comes fandom, and <em>Homestuck</em> fans proved  particularly creative. Many fan creators would later go on to join the  art and music teams of the comics, and work on later spinoffs. At the  same time, Hussie alludes in this interview to the fact that increased  fame meant increased scrutiny of their work, as nearly every update and  plot development would create controversy among the readership, to  Hussie's irritation.</p>
    <p>The comic would end in 2016, but the <em>Homestuck</em> brand would continue and outlive <em>MS Paint Adventures</em> entirely. In 2012, Hussie launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for a <em>Homestuck</em> adventure game. The campaign was successful, with the first episode of the game titled <em>Hiveswap: Act 1</em> releasing in 2017, and its second episode, <em>Act 2</em>, releasing in late 2020. Between that, visual novel spin-offs <em>Hiveswap: Friendship Simulator</em> and its sequel <em>Pesterquest</em> would be released between episodes. A duology of web novels stylized after fanfiction dubbed <em>The Homestuck Epilogues</em> was released on April 13th, 2019, on the 10th anniversary of <em>Homestuck</em>, leading to a non-canonical sequel, which has been put on hold due to negative fan response as of the time of writing.</p>
    <p>In 2020, Flash Player was phased out due to obsolescence; as such,  most of the site's Flash-based assets were converted to HTML5 elements  or uploaded to YouTube as videos, losing quality in the process. As of  the time of writing, the original Flash versions of the animations are  only available through fan-archived, non-official collections.</p>
    <p><em>MS Paint Adventures'</em> larger impact is in codifying the  interactive webcomic format, as other comics would follow its example as  early as the release of <em>Problem Sleuth</em>. Jonathan Wojcik's ongoing horror comic <em>Awful Hospital</em> uses nearly the same format as <em>MS Paint Adventures</em>,  allowing readers to input commands and using embedded audio along with  JavaScript and HTML5-enabled animation to much of the same effect.  Similarly, the website <em>MS Paint Fan Adventures</em> allows users to create, host and read comics in the style of <em>MS Paint Adventures</em>, along with providing its own suggestion box and a user interface designed to be as close to <em>MS Paint Adventures</em>' as possible. <em>WebToon</em>,  a Korean platform currently dominating the webcomic environment, also  hosts multiple comics that integrate animation and even music into their  narrative, such as <em>Room of Swords</em> or <em>Hooky</em>. Despite all this, however, no other comics since the end of <em>Homestuck</em> have managed to replicate its seamless blend of multimedia styles  presentation, partially due to the workload involved, difficulties of  development in the current online ecosystem, and the domination of  social media-compatible comics. Despite <em>Homestuck</em>'s  overwhelming success, in this day and age it remains an artifact of the  past decade, with the webcomics landscape having moved on to greener  pastures.</p>
    <p>Yet, the sheer achievement of <em>MS Paint Adventures</em> as an  experiment in format and presentation deserves more recognition for  proving its concept can be done. 22 years ago, Scott McCloud only  dreamed of a future where comics would be unbound by space of the page  and the panel and the silence of ink on paper; where a comic could  present itself in any way and shape it wanted, and stretch beyond the  physical space of a bookshelf. McCloud wondered about a far future where  Virtual Reality would let readers become part of a story, and a  less-distant future where readers could interact with and explore the  worlds of comics. At the time, he himself admitted it was a pipe dream,  but called creators to take him up on his vision. <em>MS Paint Adventures</em> proved to be lightning in a bottle – the right combination of an author  with the creative vision to push the boundaries of their own medium, a  creative community that supported this vision, and an online environment  that allowed readers to flock to them and their co-creators' worlds.  Perhaps unintentionally, Hussie and their team of artists, musicians,  fans and forum buddies created a complete, uncompromised rendition of  McCloud's concept of the Infinite Canvas; a comic that managed to use  all of the tools web media has to offer in order to tell nauseatingly  long, complex and ambitious stories, so massive they had to be written  by entire communities of readers, writers and creators, with a creative  lead at the helm who acts less like an author and more like a referee.</p>
    <p>The lesson to be learned from <em>MS Paint Adventures</em> is that  the sort of online community building unique to web media can allow  creators to transcend the boundaries of their artforms, and it is my  belief that it will again in the future. This will require them to share  in the creative process with both their fellow writers and their  audience, and to think outside the box when using the tools and methods  afforded to them. The result will no doubt be messy, confusing,  convoluted, controversial and immediately dated, but it will be a unique  snapshot of the environment that created it and the people it reached.  It will be something uniquely digital, rather than imitating the  analogue, an evolution of the form adapting to take advantage of the new  affordances at its disposal; and consequently, whatever the next artist  to see this concept all the way through ends up creating will be  something that could only have come to exist in the digital age.</p>
