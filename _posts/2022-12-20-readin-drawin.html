  <p>...são os nossos planos para a <i>jolly season.</i> Não é escapismo, mas puro niilismo activista. Fazemos-vos caso e moral a fim-de-ano com introdução de livro alheio na intersecção de culturas cruzadas: vândalos na variante punk-anarquista <em>("definição redundante"),</em> que não estranhamos nem entranhamos.</p>
<div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> We don’t want the kind of nihilism that makes it hard to get out of bed in the morning — we want the kind that keeps people out all night causing trouble. </div>

    <p>Our ideal subculture isn’t a coterie of artists — it’s more like a network of underclass gangs in which everyone has a band, a zine, or at least a criminal record. The art isn’t just what’s happening on the stage — it’s the  designs people inscribe on their jackets and shirts and bodies, the dancing and kissing and fighting and vandalism.<br>

    <p>For starters, then, we’ll set our point of departure in the creative arts: music, fashion, design, graffiti, writing, photography, petty crime.<b>These are fundamentally affirmative even when they express anger and despair — and the start-up costs are pretty low.</b> Put the music front and center, so literacy isn’t a barrier. Aesthetically, we’ll want it raw and disruptive. Throw out all claims to expertise; make a clean sweep of the classics. <span class="voice">[...]</span> Economically, if we can’t unilaterally break with the capitalist mode of production, let’s build in some norms to counteract its effects, a loathing of profiteering and all things corporate, a do-it-yourself ethic. <strong>Place all the emphasis on things that can’t be bought.</strong> If that means an embattled discourse about “authenticity,” so be it.<br>

<p><a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/10/autenticidade-prewambulo.html">Autenticidade</a>, lembram-se? <b>OS POSITIVOS</b>: aquilo atrás, aos quadrados. Não vos recomendamos o livro (434 páginas de scene-report e outros ensaios) porque não o leremos, à razão que o próprio reconhece<em> ("a self-education society without instructors, ranks, or lesson plans (...) in which each generation makes its own mistakes and charts its own path"):</em> não queremos bulas em punk. De resto, todos na mesma página:</p>

  <p>To understand why punk plateaued in the early 21st century, we have to recognize the ways that it anticipated and then was subsumed by the online networks, participatory models, and volatile identities of the Digital Age.<br>
