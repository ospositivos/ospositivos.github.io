  <p>O registo justifica-se quase exclusivamente pelo título: <i>"The End of Comics History may Finally be Coming to an End"</i> <a href="https://solrad.co/the-end-of-comics-history-may-finally-be-coming-to-an-end-a-review-of-derek-m-ballards-cartoonshow" target="_blank"><sup>11 set 2023</sup></a> no <b>SOLRAD</b> a propósito do <i>"CARTOONSHOW"</i> de <b>Derek M. Ballard</b>. Diz o crítico:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Making full use of the comics form as a way of writing with images, Ballard doesn’t tell jokes, he renders them. They are funny – when you see them. <br>

  <p>Não é um caso pela pantomima ou <i>silent comics </i>mas intersecção de imagem e texto na ordem (pun!) certa. E a intersecção certa dos comics à ordem que nos oprime escolhe-nos o que destacar nesta distribuição:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> In many ways, this sets it apart from most other autobiographies, which more commonly offer a bourgeois perspective on bourgeois lives. </p>
    <p>Despite capitalism’s best efforts, the working class inevitability produces intellectuals and artists who have something to say and refined ways of saying it. From their experiences, which are mostly marginalized in/by our mass culture, these intellectuals and artists develop new ideas and new insights, which are expressed in new aesthetic forms. These aesthetic forms have their own histories, their own nuances, their own techniques, which develop out of the conditions of working class life. It is from here, where we are often told to least expect it, that new artistic and cultural possibilities begin to take shape.<br>

  <p>Ou, mais sucinto: </p>
  <div class="info coluna">
    <blockquote>
      <p> Not by demonstrating that art about working people is good but by demonstrating that working people are capable of producing interesting, insightful, visually accomplished art.<br>

  <p>Arte. Classicista, longe de clássica, sobretudo longe do artsy-fartsy infantil, a única variante que ainda faz rondas pela academia. Colhe elogios e nada planta para o futuro: tenhamos consolo que o futuro poderá finalmente chegar ao seu fim. Aos fins senhores, aos fins — mas essa é uma história para outro dia.</p>
  <blockquote> That Ballard is able to compel this question on the strength of his visual acumen signals that<b> the stagnant fog that has enveloped the comic industrial complex for the last twenty or thirty years may finally be lifting. </b>The end of comics history may finally be coming to an end. Hallelujah.<br>
