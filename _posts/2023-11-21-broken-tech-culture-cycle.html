    <p>A nossa insistência d.i.y. em <a href="{{ site.url }}/2023/11/error.html">inteligência artificial</a> e artista vs leitor jorra da mesma veia onde já esvaimos vezes sem conta a nossa <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/03/neutering-open-web.html">excitação pela web</a> circa noventas dois mil:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The original promise of the internet that got so many of us excited about it was disintermediation – getting rid of the middlemen that act as gatekeepers between community members, creators and audiences, buyers and sellers, etc.<br>

    <p>...numa web agora dominada por plataformas fechadas dedicadas à extração de rendas dos seus utilizadores. O oposto na open web resumida que se segue — destaques nossos:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>An open internet is one <span class="voice">[...]</span> founded on access – <b>the ability to know what has gone before, to recall what has been said, and to revisit the context in which it was said</b>. Openness was not, and has never been, a guarantee of a receptive audience or even any audience at all. <strong>But because it was easy and cheap enough to put something on the web, you could leave it there long enough for others to find it.</strong> That dynamic nurtured an environment where people could have time to warm up to ideas. This is in sharp contrast to the social media world, where [anything] not immediately successful or viral was a waste of time and effort… not worth doing.<br>
