    <p>De como as infraestruturas determinam o futuro, e quem as controla, o controla. Outra vez a propósito do <a href="{{ site.url}}/2024/03/o-que-o-mundo-precisa.html">estado da web</a>, o laboratório da condição humana que historiadores e sociólogos do próximo par de milhar de anos voltarão vezes sem conta, apontando ao nosso quotidiano como Rousseau e Hobbes <i>et al</i> aludiram a míticas de bons-maus selvagens no ponto que divergiram curso. Marx teve que notar as transformações da sociedade numa altura de capitalismo infante, tão simples e tão longe de pós de neos que agora lhe conhecemos de diferentes infâmias. Estivesse vivo hoje talvez repetisse mais vezes "internet" que "classe" nos seus manifestos. Senhores, não são metáforas, é a vossa ordem social em jogo num ecrã na vossa mão:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The complex web of human interactions that thrived on the internet’s initial technological diversity is now corralled into globe-spanning data-extraction engines making huge fortunes for a tiny few.</p>
        <p>What most people have missed is how this concentration reaches deep into the internet’s infrastructure — the pipes and protocols, cables and networks, search engines and browsers. These structures determine how we build and use the internet, now and in the future.</p>
        <p>For the past decade <span class="voice">[the tech giants]</span> worked to enclose the varied, competing and often open-source or collectively provided services the internet is built on into their proprietary domains <span class="voice">[...]</span> consolidating their control deep into the underlying infrastructure through acquisitions, vertical integration, building proprietary networks, creating chokepoints and concentrating functions from different technical layers into a single silo of top-down control.</p>
        <p>Consolidation kills collaboration between service providers through the stack by rearranging an array of different relationships — competitive, collaborative — into a single predatory one. <br>

        <blockquote>
            <p>To regenerate entire habitats we need to learn from ecologists who take a whole-systems view. Ecologists know something just as important, too; how to keep going when others first ignore you and then say it’s too late, how to mobilize and work collectively, and how to build pockets of diversity and resilience that will outlast them, creating possibilities for an abundant future they can imagine but never control. <br>

    <p>Sugestão às vossas leituras de fds. "Rewild" terá diferentes concepções dependendo de onde veem, cada um trilha o caminho que lhe é natural (hey!, a nossa definição), além de dar título a três zines dos <b>P+</b> de 2014 (<a href="{{ site.url }}/2014/01/rewilding.html">aqui</a> <a href="{{ site.url }}/2014/01/rewilding-ii.html">aqui</a> e <a href="{{ site.url }}/2014/01/rewilding-3.html">aqui</a>).</p>

        Que nos serve de <i>segway</i> à segunda entrada para hoje, <i><b>"The Analog Web"</b></i> <a href="" target="_blank"><sup>16 abr 2024</sup></a>, artigo curto e que misturamos mais extensivamente para conclusão de ideias. Começa do declínio dos media <i>post-online,</i> ie, nativos digitais, em extinção acelerada nos últimos tempos <i>("a string of shutdowns that show a publishing industry turning away, or growing increasingly hostile, to the web"),</i> com apontar de dedo e culpa aos monopólios que sabemos, segue ao contraste da tecnologia digital/analógica para bases e o sumo-sumarento na ecologia identificada. <i>Mashup:</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>As we construct algorithmically-fortified communities designed to guide us towards our preferences, we become so much like automatons ourselves, steered only towards what we’ve already pre-established as our likes and dislikes. There has been a response, a countervailing force by individuals reclaiming a smaller and more personal web that actually attempts to redefine discovery through the lens of human insights and curation. Like the Luddites spited modernism, these creators are attempting to resist the dehumanization of algorithms by creating the unexpected and the unfamiliar.</p>
        <p>There is and always has been a tension at the center <span class="voice">[of the web]</span>, between commercial interests in a global network comprised of billions and a fractured community of creators building things for their own sake. Every so often, a new group shows up on the web’s fringes, hidden below the view of commercial scale, and tries stuff out. These movements have been big and small, but they have all made some impact as a collective force. Radical, creative experiments have never stopped. Owning your own piece of the Internet is itself a radical act. Linking to others at will is subversive all on its own. The web still exists for everyone. And beneath this increasingly desiccated surface, there is plenty of creators still simply creating. People create these sites simply so that they exist. They are not fed to an algorithm, or informed by any trends. It is quieter and slower, meant to tether us to a more mechanical framework of the web. <strong>This is the analog web.</strong> <b>They are handmade, and at times, even a bit weird.</b> But they represent a person in some way; an interest, an ideology, a hobby, or nothing more bold than a point of view. Because they are distinct and imperfect, these sites can resist the wave of generated content heading our way. Not to mention, there is an actual joy to creating sites on the analog web. <br>
