    <blockquote>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a little boy who grew up in the darkness. <br>
            The darkness was his friend and asked it to be his Goddess. <br>
            And this Goddess was beautiful and faceless and shapeless in the dark. <br>
            And the boy fell in love with the darkness, and he asked it to be his Goddess. </p>
        <p>And his Goddess was cruel and unforgiving, <del>just like his mother was.</del> <br>
            But the boy still obeyed the Goddess, and the wake of her fury and destruction as she drained the blood from his body into hers. <br>
            And the boy still loved the darkness because he loved the way that it hugged him, <del>and the boy had never felt a hug</del>, so he welcomed the embrace.</p>
        <p>And as the boy grew, so did his Goddess, until he was old enough to protect himself. <br>
            But the Goddess was selfish, and she wanted the boy all for herself, so she laid a trap in the forest for the boy, in the forest that she had helped him cut down. </p>
        <p>And the darkness waited, and waited, and waited, <br>
            but the boy knew there was a trap waiting for him <br>
            because the boy had been raised by the darkness, <br>
            so he knew. </p>
        <p>And the darkness waited, and waited, and waited, <br>
            but the boy knew there was a trap waiting for him, <br>
            because the boy had been raised by the darkness, <br>
            so he knew. </p>
        <p>Because the boy had been raised by the darkness,<br>
            so he knew.<br>
