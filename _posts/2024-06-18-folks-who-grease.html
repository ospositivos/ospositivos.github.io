        <p>A new type of gig is emerging, one that pays a lot less: fixing the robots' shoddy writing.<br>

    <p>Seguimos do <a href="{{ site.url }}/2024/06/bleed-black.html">impacto da IA</a> por indústrias escritas e as boas-más que vos trouxemos ontem, continuando no reverso das suposições cor-de-rosa do valor do toque humano por amanhãs com a crua realidade do hoje, o <i>"world of copywriters"</i> a exemplo, retalhado e abreviado porque ninguém nos paga à palavra:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>AI is often less expensive than a person, but early adopters are quick to learn it can't always perform on the same level. Now, people are finding themselves being asked to team up with the same robots that are stealing their jobs to give the algorithms a bit of humanity – <b>a hidden army making AI seem better than it really is</b>.<br>

        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Exemplo numa fábrica de conteúdos não identificada:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Going forward, the few people remaining were left editing ChatGPT's subpar text to make it sound more human. Mostly, it was just about cleaning things up and making the writing sound less awkward, cutting out weirdly formal or over-enthusiastic language. "It was more editing than I had to do with human writers, but it was always the exact same kinds of edits. The real problem was it was just so repetitive and boring. It started to feel like I was the robot."<br>

        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Outro:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The grammar and word choice just sound weird. You're always cutting out flowery words that don't fit in casual writing. Plus, you have to fact-check the whole thing because AI just makes things up, which takes forever because it's not just big ideas. AI hallucinates these flippant little things in throwaway lines that you'd never notice.<br>

    <p>Ora, nenhuma condolência aos poluidores da web — <em>"a great deal of copywriting work comes from website owners who want articles that will generate more traffic from Google / "I contributed to a lot of the garbage that's filling the internet and destroying it"</em> —, é mesmo onde a tendência atravessa a fantasia do marketing e invade a imprensa com alucinações de realidade e consequências na sociedade que se devem preocupar.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Other industries have seen similar examples of lower-paid human beings quietly powering the machines.<br>

        <p><b>Extra. </b>Da mesma peça, a <em>rat race</em> por qualquer outro nome, pelo chefe executivo de uma <em>"technology company that builds software to make AI writing harder to identify":</em></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I think we're going to see a lot of jobs being replaced, and freelancers will be the hardest hit. I do feel for them. But <b>these people who are getting paid to humanise AI are fantastic opportunists.</b> Sure, it's not a great job, but they have effectively recognised a new seat at a moment when we're redefining the idea of productivity. People who can learn to work with the technology are going to be OK.<br>

        <p>E o fosso entre desiguais aumenta. A IA barra a entrada de novos profissionais e força-os a uma corrida ao zero, simultaneamente garante melhores rendimentos aos já estabelecidos que passam a oferecer duas escritas: uma implementada com IA, declarada e mais acessível, ou a 100% humana no qual cobram extra. A longo prazo e por esclarecer: como aqueles que nem conseguem entrar no mercado de se fingir rotinas anónimas atingem o patamar de reconhecimento e fama que lhes permite disparar novo escalão.</p>
