    <small class="centre"><i>"<b>Trotsky</b> explained the mood more as a reation to people's normal humdrum lives than any deep-seated nationalism"</i> in <b>Chris Harman</b></small>

    <p><b>George Monbiot</b> partilha da nossa leitura dos séculos. Nas suas palavras, porque nos encontrarão sempre entre os freaks e desajustados:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The history of many centuries, including our own, shows that the default state of politics is not redistribution and general welfare, but a spiral of accumulation by the very rich, the extreme exploitation of labour, the seizure of common resources and exaction of rent for their use, extortion, coercion and violence. Normal is a society in which might is right. <b>Normal is oligarchy.</b><br>
            <small>in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/27/oligarchs-democracies-britain-1945-economic-powers" target="_blank"><i>"Things are not going to get better as long as oligarchs rule the roost in our democracies"</i></a> <sup>27 jun 2024</sup></small>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Faltou-lhe acrescentar que quando a oligarquia <sup class="asterisk">(*)</sup> <span class="sidenote sidenote-right"><i>"Oligarchs are people who translate their inordinate economic power into inordinate political power."</i></span> engorda além do <del>sustentável</del> <ins>suportável</ins> inicia-se o seu processo de decadência (e regeneração futura), intervalada por momentos de maior recalibração à igualdade. O exemplo conhecido do pós-guerra, que contrariamente ao que escreve GM <i>("there had never been a period like it in the prior history of the world, and there has not been one since")</i> cremos encontrar a cada grande eclipse imperial, serve-nos de mote à comparação do normal anormal,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It is the most anomalous politics in the history of the world (...), a remarkable period, roughly 1945 to 1975, in which, in certain rich nations, wealth and power were distributed, almost everyone could aspire to decent housing, wages and conditions, public services were ambitious and well-funded and a robust economic safety net prevented destitution.</p>
        <p>Those “normal” politics were the result of something known to economic historians as the “great compression”: a drastic reduction in inequality caused by two world wars. In many powerful countries, a combination of the physical destruction of assets, the loss of colonial and overseas possessions, inflation, very high taxes, wage and price controls, requisitioning and nationalisation required by the wartime economy, as well as the effects of rising democracy and labour organisation, greatly reduced the income and assets of the rich. It also greatly improved, once the wars had ended, the position of the poor. For several decades, we benefited from the aftermath of these great shocks.<br>

    <p>Devolve ideias ao <b>Walter Scheidel</b> que já vos <a href="{{ site.url }}/2020/10/pandemico.html">trouxemos antes</a>, e as suas <i>"only four forces have ever significantly reversed inequality: mass-mobilisation warfare, total and violent revolution, state collapse and devastating plagues."</i> Nenhuma será pacífica e olhando pela janela-ecrã, bem... bingo? Concluímos do <b>$$$</b> para receita do contra:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>We would need to do what the world wars did, without the violence and physical destruction. Political parties would need to overcome their fear of economic power: of the newspaper barons, the property developers, the fossil fuel companies, hedge funds, private equity bosses and assorted oligarchs who now fund and influence our politics. If we want even a modicum of democracy, equality, fairness and a functioning state, we need not the accommodation with economic power but the mother of all battles with it.<br>

    <p>Há um reverso nesta mãe de todas as guerras económicas e igualdade pela penúria que não será do nosso âmbito por agora — voltemos aqui amanhã ou depois se os timings forem propícios: o tempo de merda ajuda... —, mas saibam que não encontrarão consolo duradouro na destruição da sociedade como a conhecem. É um ciclo, senhores, e ainda vai piorar mais antes de piorar apenas.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In the absence of one of the four great catastrophes, income and capital inexorably accumulate in the hands of the few, and oligarchy returns.<br>
