    <p class="smallish">Ou leiam transcrição automática: corrigimos algumas calinadas mas provavelmente não todas.</p>
    <ul class="script">
        <li>Okay, so, get this. Today, we're diving into something totally different. We're headed straight to Portugal for a deep dive into their comic book scene. And no, not the mainstream stuff. We're talking about this really unique publisher called Chili Com Carne.</li>
        <li> Yeah, they're definitely not your typical comic book publisher. Think independent, little quirky, maybe even a bit chaotic.</li>
        <li>It's true, their blog, which we're using as our guide here, kind of has that raw, unfiltered vibe. It's pretty refreshing though, don't you think? </li>
        <li>Oh, absolutely. It's like taking a peek behind the scenes of their creative process. You see everything from event announcements to musings on the comic book industry as a whole. It's great. </li>
        <li>And they're not afraid to experiment either, are they? I mean, just skimming through some recent posts, I saw everything from a werewolf comic, which sounds insane by the way, to, get this, a graphic novel adaptation of Yukio Mishima's work. </li>
        <li>You're not kidding. They're not afraid of a challenge. That
            Mishima adaptation is called Mishima Blade Manifesto. It's a really interesting exploration of his work visually.</li>
        <li> Hold on, hold on, back up to the werewolf thing for a sec. What's the deal with that? </li>
        <li>Right, it's called Mesinha 40. And it sounds wild, it touches on religious satire, and even throws in some, well, drug-induced hallucinations for good measure.</li>
        <li>Okay, you've definitely got my attention with that one. But a Mishima adaptation, that's pretty ambitious. His work is considered to be, well, very complex. How do you even begin
            to adapt that. </li>
        <li>That's what makes Chili Com Carne so fascinating. They really go for it. And it's not just about the comics themselves. They're really focused on fostering a creative community too. They have this contest they run.</li>
        <li> Oh cool. Do they have like a dedicated space for events?</li>
        <li>Well not exactly a physical space but yeah. This contest they do, the prize is 500 euros and getting your comic published by Chili Com Carne.</li>
        <li>Wow that's a dream come true for aspiring artists. So they're not just
            publishing big names, they're actually looking for new talent to showcase. </li>
        <li>Absolutely. And that dedication really shines through in their publications.</li>
        <li>Speaking of which, let's dig a little deeper into some of these comics. First up, O Mesinha 40, the werewolf one. We've got werewolves, religious satire, hallucinations. It's like a fever dream on paper. What's the story? </li>
        <li>So O Mesinha 40 is actually part of this larger series called <i>Mesinha de Cabeceira</i>.
            which translates to bedside table. They release these short form comics by different artists. Each one's completely unique.</li>
        <li> I love that. It's like a little collection of artistic snapshots, these glimpses into different creative minds. </li>
        <li>Exactly. What makes O Mesinha 40 so interesting, I mean, besides the whole werewolf hallucination thing, is how well it blends autobiography, social commentary, and genre bending storytelling. It's really doing a lot.</li>
        <li> Now that's what I call maximizing your creative output.
            Okay, next up, the Mishima adaptation, Mishima Blade Manifesto. I'm still stuck on the fact that they tackled Mishima at all. How did the artist even approach that? It seems like a huge undertaking. </li>
        <li>Well, it goes to show how talented Tiago Manuel the artist is. He uses this really cool style. It's collage and cutout based. It really captures everything about Mishima's work, the beauty, the violence, the struggle between traditional and modern Japan. </li>
        <li>Tiago Manuel? That name rings a bell. </li>
        <li>Oh yeah, he's been recognized in the art world for a while now.
            Paul Gravitt even named him one of the best Portuguese artists. And that's high praise coming from Paul. </li>
        <li>OK, adding him to my list of artists to check out right now. This is why I love doing these deep dives. You find these incredible artists you might have never heard of otherwise. OK, we've got werewolves, Mishima. What else does Chili Com Carne have in store for us?</li>
        <li> How about a Finnish sheikki on the run in Sweden? </li>
        <li>Wait, what now?</li>
        <li> You heard that right. It's this comic called Sheikki PHDA, and it is as strange as it sounds. It's not all just weirdness though. Underneath it's got some really clever social commentary woven in.</li>
        <li> Finnish sheikki, you had me at Finnish sheikki. This sounds crazy in the best way possible. Tell me more. </li>
        <li>Okay, so the art style, it's super in your face, like hyperpop, which actually reflects the protagonist's mental state, and this sense of being overwhelmed by modern life. It's like the art is a character all on its own.</li>
        <li> I love when art makes you think.
            You know, when it can make you question things. </li>
        <li>And the artist, Marco Turunen, he's really good at that. He's known for blending those bright aesthetics with social commentary. Some have even compared him to Igor Hoffbauer, who's another artist known for that distinct style. </li>
        <li>It's like Chili Com Carne just has this knack for finding these artists who are pushing the boundaries of comics. They make you see the world a little different.</li>
        <li> You've hit on something really important there. It's not just about the comics. It's about Chili Com Carne's entire approach to publishing. They're giving a voice to these really unique perspectives. </li>
        <li>So it's more than just, you know, cool art. There's a bigger idea at play.</li>
        <li> Exactly. And that's what makes their work so interesting to explore. It really is, yeah. It's like they've got this whole collection of stuff you just wouldn't find in your average comic book store. You get a glimpse into a side of Portugal you don't normally see.</li>
        <li> And it's not just Portuguese artists, is it? We were talking about a British artist, a Finnish artist. It's like they have this global perspective going on. </li>
        <li>Absolutely. That first comic we talked about, <i>O Mesinha</i> 40, the one with the werewolves. Well, it's by this British artist, Andrew Smith. He actually started out in the UK, published in some pretty big magazines, even like Punch and Spectator. </li>
        <li>Wait, from Punch to werewolves in Portugal? That's quite a jump. How did he end up in the Portuguese comic book scene? </li>
        <li>Seems like Portugal called to him and his wife.
            They moved to Serpa and he's been heavily involved in the comics ever since. He's even contributed to Venham mais Cinco, which are connected to the Bedeteca de Beja. It's this big comics library and cultural center in Portugal. </li>
        <li>Ah, so it's not just Chili Con Carne. There's a whole network supporting comics over there. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And Andrew Smith's a part of it now. Yeah. It just shows how welcoming the comic book world can be, you know? For sure. Okay. So we've got Andrew Smith bringing his perspective from the UK.
            What about Tiago Manuel, the artist behind the Mishima adaptation? I'm really curious about his background now. We talked about the collage style he uses, but that's about it.</li>
        <li>Well, Tiago Manuel, he's Portuguese through and through. He studied under two really well-known Portuguese artists, Anabela Alcino and Julio Resende. So he's got this strong background in the Portuguese art world, and his work goes way beyond just comics.</li>
        <li>Oh, like what? </li>
        <li>He's had his work in galleries, not just in Portugal, internationally, too. And get this, he's even been the artistic director for exhibitions at places like the Municipal Library of Viana do Castelo and the big Bienal de Ilustração de Guimarães. </li>
        <li>Wow, so we're not just talking about a comic book artist. This guy is curating exhibitions shaping the art scene. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And he's done illustrations for newspapers too. Big ones in Portugal. Público, Expresso, Jornal de Letras. Oh, and I can't forget, illustrations for publishers like Ambar, ASA, and Afrontamento. </li>
        <li>Okay, now that's what I call a prolific artist.
            It's really impressive to see how involved he is in every aspect of the Portuguese art world. OK, so we've talked about Andrew Smith, Tiago Manuel. We can't forget about Marco Turunen, the artist who did Sheikki PHDA, the Finish It comic. How did Chili Com Carne even find him? </li>
        <li>So even though he's Finnish, Marco Turunen, he's got a connection to Portugal. Way back in 2005, he had a solo exhibition at the Salão de Lisboa de bd e ilustração. </li>
        <li>The what?
            Sorry, the name is a mouthful. </li>
        <li>Yeah, it's a bit of a tongue twister. It's one of the biggest, most important comics festivals, exhibitions in all of Portugal. Been going on for something like 30 years. For Marco Toruina to have had a solo show there back in 2005, that means he was already making waves in the Portuguese comics world. </li>
        <li>That's wild. Chili Com Carne, they're not just paying attention to what's happening in Portugal. They've got their eyes on the global comic scene too. </li>
        <li>Yeah. And Marco Toruina is a perfect example of that. His art style, as we talked about, super unique, super eye-catching.
            But then it also makes you think about the world, about society.</li>
        <li>That mix of style and substance, that's what makes his work so interesting. It's entertaining, but it also starts a conversation. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And that seems to be a pattern with the artists Chili Com Carne works with. It's not just about making comics that look cool. They're using comics as a way to say something important, to do something different, to make people think. </li>
        <li>So they've got this purpuse
            behind what they choose to publish. It's not about following trends, it's about curating a collection that really reflects their values. It's like they're saying, this is what we think comics can be, and they're putting their money where their mouth is, they're publishing all this bold, unconventional work.</li>
        <li>Yeah, exactly. They're not afraid to shake things up a bit.
            Remember that contest we talked about? Yeah. The one with the 500 euro prize and the publishing deal? </li>
        <li>Yeah, for new artists. </li>
        <li>That's a perfect example. They're really investing in the future of Portuguese comics. Finding new voices, giving them a platform. </li>
        <li>It's so cool. They're like a creative incubator for these new artists. Do they ever share stories on the blog about the contest winners? What happens to them?</li>
        <li>They do. Last year's winner, her name was Mariana, she did this really amazing graphic novel about growing up in Lisbon. It was so raw and honest. And people really took notice. She's even been invited to speak at some big international comic conventions. </li>
        <li>You see, that's what I love about what Chili Com Carne is doing. They're shining a light on these artists who might not get noticed otherwise. These fresh, unique voices. <b>It's like they're changing what Portuguese comics can even be.</b></li>
        <li><b>You got it. They're pushing the boundaries of the whole medium.</b> And that's really important to them. They even wrote in one blog post about how committed they are to showcasing all the different voices and experiences within Portuguese comics.</li>
        <li>When they say diversity, what do they mean? Like different backgrounds, styles?</li>
        <li> All of it, they publish artists from all walks of life. Experimental stuff, autobiographical, historical, you name it. If it's comics, they've probably got it.</li>
        <li>It's like this whole tapestry of creativity, all tied together by Chili Com Carne's vision. It's one thing to be able to create cool art, but to make a space for it to actually thrive, to connect with an audience, that's what they've done.</li>
        <li>Couldn't have said it better myself. This has been really eye opening, this whole deep dive into Chili Com Carne. Portuguese comics are so much more than just a niche thing.</li>
        <li>I know, right? It's a whole vibrant art form full of energy. It deserves way more attention.</li>
        <li>100%. So to everyone listening, if you're looking for something different, something exciting, something that'll make you think you need to check out Chili Com Carne and the world of Portuguese comics. Seriously, you won't regret it. Who knows? You might even find your new favorite artist. </li>
        <li>And if there's one thing to take away from all of this it's that art can connect us in some really amazing ways. It can transcend borders, remind us of what we all share. So get out there, explore, and never stop being curious.</li>
