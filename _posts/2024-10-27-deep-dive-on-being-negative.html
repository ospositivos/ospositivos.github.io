            <p>O texto é uma crítica mordaz e irónica ao panorama da banda desenhada em Portugal. O autor, assumindo uma postura negativa e até mesmo pessimista, analisa o estado da BD nacional questionando as suas diversas facetas: a dualidade entre a BD de autor e a BD "popular", a relação com o público e a crítica, e a falta de evolução e de uma identidade própria.</p>

            <p>O texto está estruturado em várias secções, todas interligadas por um fio condutor de crítica e ironia. O autor, usando uma linguagem coloquial e sarcástica, desmonta as pretensões e falhas da comunidade de autores, críticos e leitores, revelando a sua profunda desilusão com o estado da BD nacional. O autor questiona as estratégias, a qualidade da produção e a capacidade de crítica, e, em última análise, apela a uma mudança de atitude e a uma maior ambição por parte de todos os envolvidos, sejam autores, críticos, editores ou leitores.

    <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> in a nutshell, yeah, they say a lot of the criticism is superficial</div>

    <ul class="script">
        <li>Hey there, welcome to a deep dive into, uh well honestly, something I didn't know I was so curious about, the heart of Portuguese comics.</li>
        <li>We're taking on this essay and, well, it doesn't pull any punches, that's for sure. </li>
        <li>Yeah, this is definitely one of those pieces that makes you sit up and take notice. </li>
        <li>It grabs you right from the start. </li>
        <li>It does, like right out of the gate, they're diving into this whole debate about the state of Portuguese comics. </li>
        <li>Which is something I didn't even know was a thing, but clearly it is. </li>
        <li>Oh, it's definitely a thing, and this critic lays it out there. They come right out and say Portuguese comics are stuck in this weird split. </li>
        <li>Between? </li>
        <li>Comics for everyone versus, and I quote, comics for authors.</li>
        <li>Ooh, I like where this is going already. It's like two totally different worlds.</li>
        <li>Right, and what's fascinating is this isn't just like a casual observation. This critic sees this divide as a major like roadblock for Portuguese comics to actually grow. As a whole. </li>
        <li>Almost like there's this missing link somewhere. Yes. And they even use this really good image. Imagine, okay, two groups by a lake, right? Okay. You got kids splashing around, having a blast. Then over there, some older folks are just chilling, soaking up the sun. </li>
        <li>Sounds idyllic. Where's the problem? </li>
        <li>The young adults? Nowhere to be found. And for this critic, that image is everything. They're saying that's Portuguese comics right now failing to capture that key demographic because of the kind of comics being produced. </li>
        <li>So the young adults are the missing link here, and it's all because of the comics themselves. That's a bold statement. </li>
        <li>It is, but the critic really believes it's all connected.</li>
        <li>Okay then, let's unpack these two camps they're talking about. Yeah. First up, comics for everyone. What does that even mean in this context? </li>
        <li>Well, it seems like they're using that term to describe comics geared towards a broader audience. Often simpler narratives maybe, more mainstream appeal. </li>
        <li>Got it. Think like the kind of comics you'd pick up at like your local bookstore, the supermarket right? Okay, so pretty straightforward. Then we've got the flip side. Comics for authors. This is where things get a little spicy, yeah. </li>
        <li>Oh, for sure. This is where the gloves come off. They're basically suggesting that a lot of Portuguese author comics have kind of veered into this territory of being overly intellectual.</li>
        <li>Overly intellectual.</li>
        <li>Yeah, like they've prioritized artistic expression so much that they've forgotten about actually connecting with readers.</li>
        <li>So it's about entertaining a wide audience and more about the creator's singular vision, even if it means losing readers along the way.</li>
        <li>You got it. And the critic, they do not hold back. They compare these comics to like reading the back of a soapbox. </li>
        <li>Ouch. All information and jargon, none of the good stuff that actually makes you want to read. </li>
        <li>That's exactly the point they're making. They're saying a lot of these author comics, they lack that crucial element of storytelling. </li>
        <li>So it's like they get so caught up in being artsy, they forget about the reader's experience entirely. It seems that way. And the critic's stance is, well, this focus on what they call pretentiousness. It's actually harming Portuguese comics overall. </li>
        <li>It's interesting, right, because on one hand, you have this appreciation for artistic exploration, pushing boundaries, but then there's this argument that, hey, if you're alienating your audience with overly complex or obscure work, are you really achieving anything meaningful? That's the tension they're highlighting. It's a delicate balance, right? </li>
        <li>Totally. And it sounds like the critic is saying a lot of Portuguese creators are, at least in their view, kind of missing the mark. </li>
        <li>Yeah, and it's not even just a matter of taste, you know. They're suggesting that this whole author comics thing is having a real impact on the scene. </li>
        <li>OK, so it's not just about the comics themselves, but their effect on the bigger picture. What kind of impact are we talking about here? </li>
        <li>Well, that's where it takes a really interesting turn. They start arguing that this problem isn't just limited to creators. </li>
        <li>Oh, it's about the whole system. </li>
        <li>Yeah, they actually extend this critique to the world of comics criticism in Portugal.</li>
        <li>Oh, this is where things get meta. So hold on, instead of just calling out the creators, they're saying that the people talking about the comics are part of the problem too.</li>
        <li>Exactly. They basically paint this picture of a critical landscape that's too afraid to engage in honest and sometimes, you know, difficult conversations.</li>
        <li>Like they're saying the critics are being too nice.</li>
        <li>In a nutshell, yeah. They say a lot of the criticism is superficial.</li>
        <li>Okay, I'm starting to see where they're coming from. Too afraid to ruffle feathers.</li>
        <li>Right. Especially when it comes to these you know, author comics. So it's like a cycle. The creators are maybe creating work that's like a little too inward facing. And then the critics, instead of pushing back or challenging, they're just hesitant to rock the boat.</li>
        <li>That's the dynamic they're pointing to. And they are not mincing words about it either. They believe this lack of robust criticism is part of what's making Portuguese comics kind of stagnant. </li>
        <li>Makes sense. It's like, if you're not getting constructive feedback, how can you grow, right? </li>
        <li>Exactly. It becomes more about just praising everything and everyone and less about actually pushing the medium forward. </li>
        <li>Less about growth, more about just maintaining the status quo. </li>
        <li>And that, for this critic, is the real danger. To illustrate their point, they bring up this really interesting anecdote about a critic who did actually dare to write a negative review. </li>
        <li>Ooh, tell me more. When was this? </li>
        <li>Way back in 2005.</li>
        <li>Wow, going way back. And what happened? Did they get like run out of town for having an opinion? </li>
        <li>Pretty much. They describe this huge backlash this critic got for daring to criticize a popular author comic. </li>
        <li>So much for open dialogue, huh? Sounds like a textbook example of what the critic is talking about.</li>
        <li>Right. And for them, that incident just proves their point. This whole thing about being afraid to engage in critical discourse. It's like this unspoken rule. You just don't do that in the Portuguese comic scene.</li>
        <li>Which, as this critic so boldly points out, might be a big part of the problem. So we've got a bit of a standoff brewing here. On one side we've got the comics for everyone, and then on the other side we've got the comics for authors, which, according to this critic, aren't doing the Portuguese comics scene any favors. And to make matters worse, the critics themselves are just tiptoeing around the whole issue. Where do we even go from here?</li>
        <li>It's like they're caught in this web of their own making. Creators may be too focused on this one group, and the critics, well, they're not exactly helping to broaden things either. Makes you wonder, is there even a way out of this whole predicament? </li>
        <li>Right. Pointing fingers is one thing. But does the critic actually offer any solutions here? Or are we just stuck with this Doom and Gloom scenario?</li>
        <li>Well, they don't exactly give us a step-by-step how to fix it guide. But what they do offer is, in a way, even more valuable. </li>
        <li>OK, I'm intrigued. Laid on me. What's more valuable than a straight up solution?</li>
        <li>A call to action.</li>
        <li>Oh, I like the sound of that. So what are we being called to do exactly?</li>
        <li>They argue that for Portuguese comics to really, truly thrive, a shift needs to happen on like both sides of the equation.</li>
        <li>Both sides, meaning?</li>
        <li>Creators and critics. They both got to step up.</li>
        <li>OK, I'm liking this two pronged approach. So break down time. What needs to change first?</li>
        <li>On the creator side, the message is pretty clear. Stop being afraid to embrace a wider audience. Like, remember why you're even making comics in the first place.</li>
        <li>Tell stories. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And not just stories for you know, a select few, but stories that connect, that engage, that draw readers in. </li>
        <li>It's almost like they're urging creators to rediscover the simple joy of storytelling, right? That magic of crafting a narrative that just sucks people in. </li>
        <li>100%. And this whole idea that you can't be artistic and accessible, that you can't push boundaries and tell a good story that's just nonsense, according to this critic. </li>
        <li>This is about being mindful of the reader, right? Crafting something that invites them in rather than shutting them out with obscurity.</li>
        <li>Exactly. And that's where the second part of this call to action comes in the role of the critics.</li>
        <li>Okay, so how do they fit into all of this?</li>
        <li>The critic argues that critics got to step up and like foster a more open, more honest dialogue around Portuguese comics. </li>
        <li>So it's about encouraging a culture where, what, it's okay to disagree, where constructive criticism is seen as a good thing, not an attack.</li>
        <li>Exactly. It's like, how can any creative field truly grow if everyone's afraid to speak their minds? If it's all just praise and back padding, nothing's really gonna change, right? </li>
        <li>It's like that saying, iron sharpens iron. Without that friction, that exchange of ideas, things just get kind of dull, stagnant.</li>
        <li>And that's the last thing Portuguese comics need, more stagnation.</li>
        <li>Yeah, when you put it like that, it almost makes this whole critique, even though it's pretty harsh at times, sound like it's coming from a place of deep affection. Concern even. </li>
        <li>Right, it's like they're saying, look, I see the potential here, I see the talent, but you're selling yourself short by staying in this little box. </li>
        <li>Tough love for Portuguese comics, I kinda dig it. Sometimes we need that right. Someone to believe in us enough to call us out on our BS. </li>
        <li>Totally, and it's not even just directed at creators and critics, it's a challenge to the readers too, you know? Everyone who considers themselves part of this world.</li>
        <li>Interesting. How so? </li>
        <li>They seem to be saying there's this complacency, this tendency to talk about comics more than actually reading them.</li>
        <li>The classic talk the talk, but don't walk the walk scenario.</li>
        <li>Right, and that feeds into the problem. If we're more focused on promoting and praising than actually digging in and engaging with the work, it's easy to lose sight of what really matters.</li>
        <li>The stories themselves, the art, that connection between creator and reader. </li>
        <li>Exactly, and this critic is really calling everyone out.</li>
        <li>So with all this talk about what's wrong with Portuguese comics, do they offer any shining examples? You know, creators or works they feel are actually getting it right?</li>
        <li>That's the funny thing. While they spend a lot of time outlining the problems, they're pretty quiet when it comes to specific examples of, like, good Portuguese comics. </li>
        <li>Hmm, interesting. Is that an oversight or something more deliberate, do you think? </li>
        <li>I'm going to go with deliberate on that one. Remember that image of the lake? The one with the missing young adults?</li>
        <li>Oh, could I forget? Seems pretty central to their whole argument.</li>
        <li>Exactly, it's like they're suggesting that even the very definition of what makes a good Portuguese comic needs to be broadened.</li>
        <li>Instead of giving us a list of their favorites, they're challenging us to go out and discover what resonates with us.</li>
        <li>Boom, you got it.</li>
        <li>Almost like they're saying, hey, don't just take my word for it, go see for yourself.</li>
        <li>Exactly. Get out there, explore the diversity, form your own opinions. I think there's something really powerful about that approach, actually. </li>
        <li><strong>It's definitely more engaging than just being told what to think, right?</strong></li>
        <li>Right. It invites you to be an active participant in the Portuguese comics scene, not just a passive consumer.</li>
        <li>So, less scrolling, more reading.</li>
        <li>Precisely. Engage with the medium on a deeper level, challenge those assumptions about what Portuguese comics are, you know? Yeah. What they have the potential to be. </li>
        <li>And hey. Maybe discover some hidden gems along the way that you never would have found otherwise.</li>
        <li>There you go. It's all about that sense of discovery, being willing to venture outside the familiar. That's what this critic is really championing, I think.</li>
        <li>It's refreshing. You know, they could have easily just been like, here are my top 10 favorite Portuguese comics. Go read them. But instead.</li>
        <li>But instead, they left that space open, invited us to join the conversation, shape our own understanding. </li>
        <li>Which, to me, speaks volumes about their belief in this medium. They're not just preaching from on high, they're saying, come on, let's figure this out together. </li>
        <li>Totally. A joint effort between creators, critics, and readers. Everyone has a role to play in shaping the future of Portuguese comics. </li>
        <li>Which brings us to that final question this critic poses, the one that's really been sticking with me. </li>
        <li>Oh yeah, that question gets you thinking, doesn't it? It's like this perfect encapsulation of the challenge and the opportunity facing Portuguese comics right now. </li>
        <li>Well, don't leave us hanging. What's the question?</li>
        <li>All right, here it is. And I quote, in a landscape seemingly dominated by children's comics and a handful of artists content to talk amongst themselves, what will it take for Portuguese comics to finally grow up?</li>
        <li>Ooh, they went there. Right, bold statement.</li>
        <li>But it makes you think, doesn't it? It's a question that stays with you long after you finish reading. </li>
        <li>It really does. And it challenges us to be honest about where things stand about both the strengths and the weaknesses of the Portuguese comic scene right now.</li>
        <li>And ultimately what we're gonna do about it, because it's not just up to the creators, right? It's a collective effort.</li>
        <li>Exactly. We all have a part to play in shaping the future of this medium.</li>
        <li>Do you think they're being too harsh though? I mean, saying Portuguese comics need to grow up. </li>
        <li>I get where you're coming from. It's definitely a provocative statement, but I don't think it's coming from a mean-spirited place. More like. Tough love. </li>
        <li>Yeah, exactly. To me, it reads as someone who deeply cares about Portuguese comics and wants to see them reach their full potential. That's a good way to put it. They're not saying it's bad, just that it could be so much more.</li>
        <li>Exactly, it's like they're holding up a mirror and saying, look, this is where you are, but don't be afraid to dream bigger, to push boundaries, to really embrace everything this medium has to offer. </li>
        <li>And that's a message I can get behind. This deep dive has definitely given me a lot to chew on. What about you? What resonated most with you? </li>
        <li>Honestly? It's their unwavering belief in the power of comics, you know, this idea that it's a medium with limitless potential, capable of reaching anyone and everyone.</li>
        <li>And they're challenging Portuguese comics to own that potential, to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight.</li>
        <li>Exactly. It's a call to action, an invitation to be a part of something bigger, to contribute to the evolution of a truly vibrant and dynamic art form. </li>
        <li>Well said. I don't know about you, but I'm suddenly feeling very inspired to seek out some Portuguese comics. Time to put my money where my mouth is, right? </li>
        <li>That's the spirit. And remember, this deep dive wasn't about giving you all the answers. It was about sparking that curiosity, encouraging you to dive in and discover for yourself.</li>
        <li>Because who knows, you might just find your new favorite comic along the way. Or even be inspired to create your own. The possibilities are endless.</li>
        <li>That's all the time we have for today's deep dive into the world of Portuguese comics. But as always conversation doesn't end here. So keep exploring, keep reading, and keep those pages turning. Until next time.</li>
