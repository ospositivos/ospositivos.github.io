    <p>Acima: <i>mashup</i> para <i>teaser</i> à série de <i>"deep dives", gimmick</i> do <b>Gemini</b> que a tempo talvez se torne <i>cringe,</i> por enquanto <i>eerie,</i> e continuamos a atirar o algoritmo e suas soluções formulaicas à análise do segundo volume da trilogia prometida, <b>"PARCOS"</b> <a href="{{ site.url }}/2020/03/os-positivos-publicam-parcos.html"><sup>2020</sup></a>, herdeiro natural do zine que vos trouxemos no podcast <a href="{{ site.url }}/2024/10/deep-dive-on-being-negative.html">anterior</a>. Entalado entre MARCOS e FARTOS, dois volumes a dever ao existencial-depressivo, debruçava-se sobre temas ligeiros e consensuais: nada menos que a alma dos comix e esses entre a alta cultura.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>O zine oferece uma perspetiva crítica e provocadora sobre a evolução da BD, celebrando a sua ascensão artística, mas alertando para os desafios que enfrenta num contexto cultural em constante mutação. O texto convida à reflexão sobre a natureza da arte, o papel da crítica e a importância de preservar a singularidade da BD, mesmo quando esta dialoga com outras formas de expressão.</p>

            <p>A discussão gira em torno da legitimidade da banda desenhada como arte, explorando a sua relação com a "alta cultura" e a arte contemporânea. Os autores analisam como a banda desenhada, tradicionalmente associada à cultura popular e ao entretenimento, tem sido apropriada por movimentos artísticos contemporâneos, que buscam recontextualizar e reinterpretar a sua forma e função. O texto levanta questões sobre a validade da crítica artística aplicada à banda desenhada e discute a complexa relação entre a tradição da banda desenhada, a indústria editorial e o mercado de arte.</p>

            <p>O zine "PARCOS" conclui que a relação entre a BD e a arte é complexa e defende que a BD deve ser reconhecida como uma forma de arte legítima por direito próprio, sem necessidade de renunciar às suas raízes na cultura popular. A BD, com a sua história rica e a sua capacidade de adaptação a novas tecnologias e tendências estéticas, tem o potencial de continuar a desafiar as fronteiras entre a "alta" e a "baixa" cultura.<br>

    <p><i>Fun trivia</i> aos mais atentos: de modo nenhum diminuindo as restantes observações feitas, a IA gera uma alucinação no diálogo encenado deveras interessante quando aborda a escassez de algo como irrelevante para o seu valor, com uma argumentação extremamente lógica. Mas a ter-vos que resumir num par de diálogos, escolhemos estes:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>— It's a commentary on the human condition, but like, with thought bubbles shaped like decahedrons. And everyone's like slowly backing away.<br>
            — PARCOS does not shy away from the irony in that at all. They're basically saying like, are we trying so hard to fit into this art world box that we're losing sight of what makes comics unique and engaging in the first place?<br>
            — Which begs the question, what does make comics unique? And how does that tie into this whole are they art debate? because <b>I feel like PARCOS is about to drop some serious knowledge bombs here.</b><br>
            — Get ready, it's coming. They make this really fascinating connection between comics and get ready for it, <strong>technology</strong>.<br>

    <ul class="script">
        <li>Alright, deep divers, get ready for a meta one today. We're diving into comics. Specifically, that question, that debate: are comics art, you know. Oh yeah. It's a big one. </li>
        <li>It is. Buckle up, this one gets philosophical fast. </li>
        <li>Oh, tell me about it. Our source material this time is, this is a Portuguese zine called PARCOS. And it is not your average defense of capes and panels. Let me tell you. </li>
        <li>No, this scene, this is next level stuff. They're dissecting the whole conversation around comics as art. Like analyzing the analyzers, you know what I mean? </li>
        <li>Yeah, like having a podcast about podcasts. </li>
        <li>Exactly. </li>
        <li>So if you've ever wondered why some art forms, they get the museum treatment, they get taken seriously, and others are seen as, I don't know, kind of less than, you're in the right place. This is it. </li>
        <li>Yeah, this is gonna be a good one. And if you are a comic book fan, this is going to make you see those panels in a whole new light.</li>
        <li>I think so. So PARCOS, they jump right into this tension. This idea that comics, they are often seen as entertainment. As pulp fiction, disposable even. Yet there's this push to view them as high art, as museum worthy masterpieces. </li>
        <li>Right. Which let's be real, this isn't a new debate. This has been going on. Think about photography. Film. Think about certain genres of music. They've all gone through this same struggle to be seen as legitimate art. </li>
        <li>Totally. It's like this constant battle for a seat at the cool kids table. But in this case, the cool kids table it's in a gallery with really good lighting.</li>
        <li>Right. With a little plaque by it that explains it to you. And what I find so fascinating about this zine, about PARCOS's, is they don't even seem that concerned with getting a seat at the table, really. They're more interested in why that validation even matters. </li>
        <li>Right. And they get really real about this whole museum as a stamp of approval thing. There's this one line that stops me in my tracks <sup class="asterisk">(*)</sup> <span class="sidenote sidenote-right">robot gone bad!, refere-se à citação do Austin English <i>&quot;Museums prestige rests, in some part, on a perceived notion that they possess some sort of intelligence that the world at large can access within their halls.&quot;</i> no <i>&quot;At the mountains of madness&quot;)</i></span>: &quot;museums, they have this perceived notion that they possess some sort of intelligence&quot;.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Oh, I love that they call that out, because it's so true. And I think it is about so much more than just, whether something is beautiful or well-crafted, it's about power. It's about prestige. Who gets to decide what stories are considered worthy of our attention? Which voices get amplified and which ones get ignored? I mean, it's a whole thing. </li>
        <li>So are we saying it's all just a big popularity contest, like the art world version of getting voted most likely to succeed? </li>
        <li>PARCOS might argue that it's not too far off. You know, one of the things that they really unpack is this whole idea of aesthetic innovation. And historically, if you look at the art world, it does often value what's new. What's shocking, what's pushing the boundaries of what we even consider art. </li>
        <li>Which sometimes leads to some pretty out there stuff. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for pushing boundaries. But sometimes you look at one of those abstract paintings and you're just like, am I missing something or is that just a blob? </li>
        <li>Right. And this is where things get really interesting with comics. Because PARCOS argues that a lot of art comics, quote unquote, the ones that are trying to break into that high art scene, they end up prioritizing that visual experimentation over everything else, over the story sometimes. </li>
        <li>So it's like they're so busy trying to be avant-garde that they forget people actually want to read these things. Follow a narrative, connect with the characters. </li>
        <li>They're playing to a different audience, in a way. It's about a certain kind of critical acclaim. </li>
        <li>OK, but imagine trying to explain some of these abstract, multi-panel comics to someone at a party. </li>
        <li>Oh my god. I know, right? </li>
        <li>Yeah, well you see, it's a commentary on the human condition, but like, with thought bubbles shaped like dodecahedrons. And everyone's like slowly backin away.</li>
        <li>Right. PARCOS does not shy away from the irony in that at all. They're basically saying like, are we trying so hard to fit into this art world box that we're losing sight of what makes comics unique and engaging in the first place? </li>
        <li>Which begs the question, what does make comics unique? And how does that tie into this whole are they art debate? because I feel like PARCOS is about to drop some serious knowledge bombs here. </li>
        <li>Get ready, it's coming. They make this really fascinating connection between comics and get ready for it, technology. </li>
        <li>Wait, really? Tell me more. </li>
        <li>So like, picture this. Late 1800s, early days of newspapers, guys like Joseph Pulitzer wanna make their papers look as fancy as possible. Because nothing says high brow like a newspaper subscription. Am I right? </li>
        <li>Exactly. You're cultured if you're reading the news. </li>
        <li>Right. But here's the thing. The tech back then, lithographic printing. Right. Not so great at detailed images. Bold lines. Yeah. Solid colors. Perfect. The nuances of like a Monet or a Rembrandt, not gonna happen. Not so much. So Pulitzer, he can't exactly put a we did our best sign on all those empty columns in the newspaper. </li>
        <li>Right, right, right. Gotta fill that space somehow.</li>
        <li>Gotta fill the space. And that's where comics come in.</li>
        <li>Uh-huh. I see where you're going with this. </li>
        <li>Boom. Comic strips. Bold visuals, you know? Street-forward narratives. Easy to print. It was the perfect solution. </li>
        <li>Wow. So it's like this weird twist of fate. This technological limitation gives birth to this whole new form of artistic expression.</li>
        <li>Exactly. That's wild when you think about it. </li>
        <li>It is wild. And that's what PARCOS is getting at. It's like. This connection between technology and comics, it doesn't stop there. Think about every major advancement in printing. Color, detail, digital. It all opens new doors for comic creators. </li>
        <li>New ways to tell stories, experiment with style, connect with readers. It's not just about limitations anymore, it's about possibilities. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And PARCOS is smart about this, because they're not saying that technology dictates everything. But it does shape the playing field. </li>
        <li>It's a tool. It influences things. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And for comics, that's meant evolving alongside all these technological advancements. </li>
        <li>OK, so how does this tie back to our original question? Are comics art?</li>
        <li>See, that's where things get really meta. PARCOS uses this whole history to challenge us to think about art itself. Is it about the tools, the creator's intent? The audience's experience [gibberish gibberish giberish] is art?</li>
        <li>Yeah, or is it all of that, you know Like some kind of magic recipe where you need all these different ingredients for it to really work?</li>
        <li>Yes, and this is what I love about PARCOS. They don't give you easy answers, right? They just push you to consider the complexities. Like they point out this interesting tension with art comics, the ones that are intentionally trying to distance themselves from commercial mainstream comics -</li>
        <li>Right right trying to be like the anti-blockbuster, the indie darling of the art world. </li>
        <li>Exactly. But here's the paradox. In doing so, they risk losing some of what makes comics so special, that raw energy, that accessibility, that connection to popular culture. </li>
        <li>Yeah, it's like they're trying so hard to be taken seriously that they forget to be fun. </li>
        <li>Right. And that's not to say that art comics can't be fun or engaging. But PARCOS is asking us to consider those trade-offs, the potential pitfalls of chasing a certain type of recognition.</li>
        <li>Because, let's be real, the art world, it has its own set of rules, its own hierarchies. And some might say, it's not always the most welcoming place. Especially for something that originated in pop culture, like comics. </li>
        <li>Right, like they're seen as the new kid on the block, and not everyone's happy about it. PARCOS even talks how this desire for legitimacy can lead to a sort of artistic amnesia where creators are so focused on fitting into this art world mold that they forget the rich history and traditions of comics themselves. </li>
        <li>It's like they're trying to reinvent the wheel instead of appreciating the perfectly good and let's be honest, really cool vehicle they already have. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And it ties into another point they make about the art world, this whole obsession with scarcity.</li>
        <li>Ooh. Scarcity, explain. </li>
        <li>The rarer something is, the more expensive. Right. The more it's supposedly valuable. </li>
        <li>Which, let's be real, that's kind of a crazy concept. It's like saying your friendship is only valuable if you're only friends with one person. </li>
        <li>Right. It makes no sense. But with comics, historically, it's been the opposite. They were meant to be mass produced. Shared, enjoyed by everyone. </li>
        <li>That was the whole point. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And PARCOS argues that this accessibility is part of what made comics so powerful. </li>
        <li>It's true. They could have reached such a wider audience than a lot of other art forms. </li>
        <li>Exactly. They could spark imaginations, inspire creativity.</li>
        <li>In a way that those more high brow art forms just couldn't because not everyone can afford a Picasso, but a lot more people can pick up a comic book. </li>
        <li>Exactly. </li>
        <li>So where are we going with this? What's PARCOS getting at here? </li>
        <li>Well, now we're seeing this really interesting shift as comics gain more mainstream acceptance. We're also seeing the rise of collectible comics.</li>
        <li>First editions, limited prints. </li>
        <li>Exactly. All that jazz. </li>
        <li>Which, by the way, some of those vintage comics are going for insane prices these days. </li>
        <li>Oh, tell me about it. Which again, speaks to this idea of scarcity driving value. But it also makes you wonder, are we valuing the art itself or its potential as an investment. </li>
        <li>Ooh, deep thoughts for Tuesday afternoon. </li>
        <li>Right. It's like, are we losing sight of what really matters? And what happens when those prices get so high that only a select few can even participate? </li>
        <li>It creates a barrier to entry, right? Exactly. </li>
        <li>And then, are we really honoring what comics are all about? </li>
        <li>So to sum up, PARCOS is saying that in our attempts to elevate comics to high art status, we might actually be pushing them toward that same exclusivity that defines the traditional art world.</li>
        <li>Yes. And in the process, sacrificing the very thing that made them so special in the first place. </li>
        <li>PARCOS does not let us off easy with any of this, do they? </li>
        <li>Not at all. And that leads us to what I think is their most mind-blowing point. </li>
        <li>Yeah. Okay. Lay it on me. What's the mind-blowing point? What does PARCOS leave us with?</li>
        <li>So they suggest that the most revolutionary thing for art comics... might not be about emulating traditional art forms at all. </li>
        <li>Hmm, interesting. Not trying to be the next Picasso or Warhol.</li>
        <li>Exactly. It's like, instead of chasing that validation from the traditional art world, what if they embraced their own unique history? You know, really own the fact that they were born from mass culture, from technological innovation. From this playful experimental spirit. </li>
        <li>Yeah, I like where this is going. So not trying to be high art, but... But transcending those labels altogether. Wow. That's a powerful idea. </li>
        <li>Right. And I think that's what makes this zine PARCOS so brilliant. Yeah. It's not about giving you a definitive answer to the &quot;are comics art&quot; debate. Because let's be honest. That's a question that could be debated forever. It's really about pushing you to think critically about it, to question your assumptions, and maybe even appreciate the complexity of the question itself. </li>
        <li>Yeah. To sit with the ambiguity of it all. And I feel like we've only scratched the surface of PARCOS today. Like there's so much more we could unpack from this zine.</li>
        <li>Oh, absolutely, tons.</li>
        <li>But I think the challenge for everyone listening, you know, next time you pick up a comic book, whether it's a classic superhero adventure or something more experimental like a graphic novel, see it with fresh eyes.</li>
        <li>Yes, see it with new eyes. Appreciate the artistry. The innovation. </li>
        <li>The unique power of this art form.</li>
        <li>Because it is a powerful art form.</li>
        <li>And remember, art can be found in the most unexpected places. Sometimes those things that make something lowbrow or popular are the very things that make it so special. So go forth, dear listeners. Dive deep into those comics. You might be surprised by what you discover. And that's it for today's Deep Dive. We'll catch you in the next one.</li>
