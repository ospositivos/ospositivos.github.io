        <p>— Sounds like media criticism.<br>
            — Definitely. And this isn't just media criticism. It's a whole vibe of skepticism towards technology and information overload. It's like they were ahead of the curve on that feeling of being trapped by technology.<br>
            - But it also makes you wonder, what does it mean to be positive in a world increasingly dominated by technology? What does that even look like?<br>
            - Hmm. That's the heart of it, isn't it? So maybe the skepticism towards technology wasn't just about the tech itself, but about the systems that represented the power dynamics of play.<br>

    <p>Acima: <i>mashup</i> para <i>teaser</i> à série de <i>"deep dives", gimmick</i> do <b>Gemini</b> que a tempo talvez se torne <i>cringe,</i> por enquanto <i>eerie,</i> e continuamos a atirar o algoritmo e suas soluções formulaicas à análise do volume inicial da trilogia que nos ocupa, <b>"MARCOS"</b> <a href="{{ site.url }}/2020/02/marcos-o-zine.html"><sup>2020</sup></a>, que com FARTOS concluiria uma viagem mais sentida e/ou séria (o PARCOS no meio, como em diversas outras ocasiões neste espaço, serviu para arejar, incidindo sobre o nosso <i>go-to</i> para recalibrar de inocências, os cómicos dos outros).

            <p>Este zine é uma coleção [de comics] publicados online e impressos. Os autores descrevem o zine como uma forma de "insulto geral às artes e hostilidades várias", apresentando uma mistura de humor, crítica social e experimentação com a forma. O conteúdo é diversificado, abordando temas como política, cultura pop, tecnologia e vida quotidiana, tudo apresentado através de um estilo provocativo e irreverente.<br>

    <p>Ou, comentado pelo casal John &amp; Jane Doe que podem acompanhar em podcast numa qualquer viagem entre os vossos afazeres, aqui baralhado para maior clareza:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p> — Wait, are we connecting this back to a punk? So it's now anti-establishment DIY, that kind of thing. The skepticism towards technology, the media criticism, even the questioning of what it means to be positive in a world that often feels anything but. <br>
            — Right, but OS POSITIVOS's seem to be doing something more nuanced. It feels like they're playing with our expectations using humor to subvert the seriousness of these topics they're tackling. And it's that willingness to confront those complexities to find humor in the darkness that makes their work so compelling.<br>
            — I'm reminded of those classic Portuguese satirical cartoons, the ones that poked fun at authority figures and societal norms. It's like, OS POSITIVOS are carrying on that tradition, but with the 21st century twist.<br>
            — It's definitely self aware, playful, maybe even a bit mischievous. It feels like OS POSITIVOS are kind of winking at us. It's like OS POSITIVOS are reminding us that even in the face of uncertainty, we still have the power to change the world.<br>
            — And that's a powerful message, wouldn't you say?<br>

    <ul class="script">
        <li>Okay, so today we're doing something a little different. We're diving into the world of Portuguese zines.</li>
        <li>Okay.</li>
        <li>Specifically in excerpt called Marcos-dot-PDF. This isn't just any old scene. This is like a time capsule right from a group called OS POSITIVOS. It's their table of contents greatest hits all rolled into one.</li>
        <li>Yeah.</li>
        <li>What's going to be curious is this date range 2016 to 2020.</li>
        <li>Okay.</li>
        <li>Seems like we're about to get a very specific snapshot of Portuguese culture at this time, right?</li>
        <li>Absolutely. And I think to understand the context, it's important to remember that zines, especially in Portugal, have a very unique flavor. They're self published raw unfiltered away for subcultures and alternative viewpoints to thrive.</li>
        <li>Right. So not just a bunch of comic book fans then.</li>
        <li>Yeah.</li>
        <li>Though speaking of which, what kind of comics are we even talking about here? Because the intro they wrote for this excerpt is kind of amazing. They're all about assaults on good taste, subverting timelines and get this humor and depressing.</li>
        <li>Wow.</li>
        <li>Yeah. That's intriguing combo. Are we talking dark humor here? What's the overall vibe you're getting?</li>
        <li>Yeah. It's definitely self aware, playful, maybe even a bit mischievous. It feels like OS POSITIVOS are kind of winking at us even as they're critiquing wild something. And that humor and depression pairing. I think it hints at a certain Portuguese sensibility almost like they're acknowledging that life can be tough, maybe a bit depressing.</li>
        <li>Yeah.</li>
        <li>But finding humor in it all is a way to cope, even rebel a little. </li>
        <li>It makes you wonder what was happening in Portugal during those years, what they were reacting to.</li>
        <li>Exactly.</li>
        <li>And that's where looking at the titles in this excerpt gets really interesting.</li>
        <li>Yeah. Some of these are jumping out of me like &quot;newscast conclusions&quot; and &quot;novos alfabetos&quot;, &quot;new literates&quot;. Sounds like media criticism.</li>
        <li>Definitely. And it goes even deeper when you see titles like &quot;art by algorithm&quot;, &quot;cheating on big data&quot;. Even &quot;back in tha digital cage&quot;. This isn't just media criticism. It's a whole vibe of skepticism towards technology and information overload.</li>
        <li>Whoa.</li>
        <li>And this was all before the pandemic really accelerated a lot of those anxieties. It's like they were ahead of the curve on that feeling of being trapped by technology. It makes you wonder if this digital skepticism was amplified in Portugal for some reason, where this is just like a global feeling they are tapping into.</li>
        <li>That's a great question. And I think it speaks to the larger context here. While those anxieties about technology were certainly spreading globally, how they manifested in Portugal, could be linked to their unique history and cultural landscape. Remember, this is a country with a strong tradition of satire and social critique, often expressed through art and literature. So these zines with their provocative titles could be seem part of that lineage.</li>
        <li>That's fascinating. Oh. So they're drawing on older traditions of descent, but channeling it through this very modern anxiety about tech. And then we've got this title, "Os punk's são modernos", punk's are modern. Wait, are we connecting this back to a punk? So it's now anti-establishment DIY, that kind of thing.</li>
        <li>Yeah, it's very possible. Remember, punk was all about questioning authority, embracing a DIY ethos, finding power and being on the fringes. And also OS POSITIVOS with those with their self published scenes and in your face critiques seem to embody that same spirit.</li>
        <li>And that DIY aesthetic would make sense given that we're talking about zines.</li>
        <li>Exactly. Think photocopied pages, hand drawn images, maybe some collage work. That raw unpolished look is all part of the message.</li>
        <li>It's a statement for sure. It's like they're saying, we don't need fancy studios or big publishers to make our voices heard.</li>
        <li>Right.</li>
        <li>They're taking control of their own narratives. Which knowing what we do now about their name, OS POSITIVOS, seems kind of interesting.</li>
        <li>Yeah, their name, the positives. Given all this tech skepticism and social critique, it seems like they're not going to be able to do it. Almost ironic, wouldn't you say?</li>
        <li>Right. It feels like they're playing with our expectations using humor to subvert the seriousness of these topics they're tackling.</li>
        <li>Or maybe it's a way of reclaiming some power. Like, yes, the world can be oblique place, but we're choosing to find the humor in it.
            We're choosing to stay positive.</li>
        <li>I like that. It fits with that playful rebellious tone we were talking about. But it also makes you wonder, what does it mean to be positive in a world increasingly dominated by technology? What does that even look like?</li>
        <li>Hmm. That's the heart of it, isn't it? And to think this zine with its hand drawn aesthetic and thought provoking titles was circulating in Portugal, just as smartphones are really starting to dominate our lives, it makes their message feel even more poignant.</li>
        <li>It's like they were anticipating that feeling of being overwhelmed by the digital world, the constant influx of information, the pressure to always be on.</li>
        <li>Exactly. And let's not forget, Portugal in the late 2010s was also grappling with the aftermath of the European debt crisis. There was a sense of economic uncertainty, political disillusionment.</li>
        <li>So maybe the skepticism towards technology wasn't just about the tech itself, but about the systems that represented the power dynamics of play.</li>
        <li>Precisely. Remember that title, Newscast conclusions. It makes you think about who controls the narrative, who gets to decide what's important, what we should be paying attention to.</li>
        <li>Yeah, it's interesting though that they chose humor as part of their message. It would have been easy to just be angry cynical.</li>
        <li>Right, but OS POSITIVOS's seem to be doing something more nuanced. They're using humor as a way to engage with these anxieties, to process them, maybe even to find some light in the darkness. And that I think is a very Portuguese way of dealing with things.</li>
        <li>Oh, totally. I'm reminded of those classic Portuguese satirical cartoons, the ones that poked fun at authority figures and societal norms. It's like, OS POSITIVOS are carrying on that tradition, but with the 21st century twist.</li>
        <li>Absolutely. And that connection to a longer history of satire and social critique is crucial to understanding their message. They're not just reacting to technology in a vacuum. They're drawing on a rich cultural heritage of questioning the status quo.</li>
        <li>I guess you wonder how people reacted to their zines back then. Do they have a following? Do they ruffle any feathers?</li>
        <li>Yeah, it's hard to say for sure without more information, but given the often provocative nature of zines, it's likely they sparked some interesting conversations. And even if they were just preaching to the choir, so to speak, within a small subculture, there work still offers a valuable glimpse into the anxieties and aspirations of a specific time and place.</li>
        <li>And it makes me wonder how those same themes resonate today in a world where those anxieties about technology and information overload have only intensified.</li>
        <li>That's a great point. I mean, think about it. We're constantly bombarded with news, social media updates, notifications.</li>
        <li>It's exhausting. And don't even get me started on algorithms and how they shape what we see and how we think. It's enough to make anyone want to chuck their smartphone out the window and go live in a yurt.</li>
        <li>Maybe not a yurt, but I think you're tapping into something important. There's this growing awareness of the downsides of our digital lives, this desire for more authenticity, more human connection.</li>
        <li>And that's what makes OS POSITIVOS so fascinating, right? Even though we only have this fragment of their work, this table of contents, we're getting a sense of a group of artists grappling with those very different things. And we're getting questions using humor in DIY aesthetics to create something meaningful, something that speaks to a specific cultural moment, but also feels surprisingly universal.</li>
        <li>Exactly. And it highlights the enduring power of zines as a form of expression. Even in the digital age, there's something about that tactile experience that DIY spirit that continues to resonate. </li>
        <li>It's like a direct line to someone else's thoughts, raw and unfiltered, no algorithms, no corporate gatekeepers, just pure creative experience.</li>
        <li>And that [?? giberish ??] is reflected in their choice of themes too. They're not shying away from the difficult questions, the anxieties of their time.</li>
        <li>Right. It's all there in their titles, the skepticism towards technology, the media criticism, even the questioning of what it means to be positive in a world that often feels anything but.</li>
        <li>And it's that willingness to confront those complexities to find humor in the darkness that makes their work so compelling.</li>
        <li>It's interesting because even though their message seems to be rooted in a specific time and place, you know, Portugal in the late 2010s, it also feels incredibly relevant to what a lot of us are feeling today. That tension between wanting to engage with technology, but also feeling overwhelmed by it, that search for meaning and authenticity in a world just saturated with information. It's a universal experience.</li>
        <li>It absolutely is. And I think that's what makes OS POSITIVOS so fascinating. You know, even though we only have this brief glimpse into their world through this table of contents, they've managed to capture something about the human condition in the digital age, something that transcends borders and time zones.</li>
        <li>It makes you wonder, though, what their work would look like today, with all that's happened since 2020, the pandemic, the rise of even more advanced technologies. Would they be even more skeptical? Would they find new ways to use humor as a form of resistance?</li>
        <li>That's the question, isn't it? It's almost as if they've left us with a challenge. How do we navigate these complexities? How do we stay true to ourselves in a world that's constantly trying to shape who we are?</li>
        <li>Right. And how do we find those moments of joy, those flashes of humor, even when it feels like the world is going a bit haywire? It's like OS POSITIVOS are reminding us that even in the face of uncertainty, we still have the power to change the world. We choose how we respond, how we create, how we connect with one another.</li>
        <li>And that's a powerful message, wouldn't you say?</li>
        <li>Absolutely. It's a reminder that even a seemingly obscure zine tucked away in some corner of the internet can spark these kinds of reflections, these connections to larger questions about who we are and how we want to live in the world. So for anyone listening who's feeling a little overwhelmed by the digital deluge, maybe take a cue from OS POSITIVOS. Embrace the DIY spirit. Find the humor in the darkness and never underestimate the power of a good zine.</li>
        <li>Well said.</li>
        <li>And on that note, we'll wrap up this deep dive into the world of Portuguese zines. Until next time, keep exploring, keep questioning, and keep an eye out for those hidden corners of the culture. You never know what you might find.</li>
