    <p>Acima: <i>mashup</i> para <i>teaser</i> à série de <i>"deep dives", gimmick</i> do <b>Gemini</b> que a tempo talvez se torne <i>cringe,</i> por enquanto <i>eerie,</i> e continuamos a atirar o algoritmo e suas soluções formulaicas concluindo trilogia com <b>"FARTOS"</b> <a href="{{ site.url }}/2020/09/fartos-o-zine.html"><sup>2020</sup></a>, o nosso covid-19 <i>special</i> e fecho de arco narrativo aberto em <b>&quot;MARCOS&quot;</b> onde a Máquina acusou tópicos como "Tecnologia e internet", "Cultura de massas e consumismo", "Política e poder", "Ansiedade e depressão", "<i>desafia(ndo) o leitor a questionar as suas próprias crenças e a confrontar as contradições do mundo em que vive</i>"<i>. </i>Encontra-lhe ecos neste volume final como "Isolamento e introspecção", "Subjetividade e interpretação", e o inevitável "Crítica cultural".

    <p>Culpados da citação. Onde MARCOS era cartoon editorial para comichão dos gentios, FARTOS saiu de dentro virado para dentro  a dever juros às dívidas existenciais. <em>Anyhoos,</em> sumário:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>FARTOS apresenta-se como um projeto ambicioso de crítica cultural e artística, utilizando o formato zine e uma linguagem visual e textual experimental. Através de um tom sarcástico e provocador, os autores exploram temas como isolamento, subjetividade e a desilusão com a cultura contemporânea. A referência a "A História do Barquinho" e a citação de John Donne adicionam camadas de significado, convidando o leitor a uma análise mais profunda da obra.<br>

    <ul class="script">
        <li>All right, so today we're diving deep into some Portuguese zine culture. </li>
        <li>That's interesting. </li>
        <li>Yeah, and we're looking specifically at &quot;You Lucky bastard, hashtag&quot; published September 2020. And just so you know, zine are like these raw, unfiltered looks into creativity, you know? But this one is really special because it was right in the heart of those early pandemic days. When the world felt like it was holding its breath, you know? So it's like a time capsule. </li>
        <li>Exactly, yeah. It takes you right back to that headspace, right? Remember that feeling, everybody trying to make sense of this huge global event and &quot;You lucky bastard hashtag&quot; just throws us right back there. And even the title itself is kind of a clue, right? </li>
        <li>Oh yeah, how so?</li>
        <li>Well, it's borrowed from John Donne's &quot;Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions&quot;. Wow. Which kind of hints at the heavy stuff they're getting into in these pages. It's almost confrontational. </li>
        <li>Yeah. It's like, yeah, we're all feeling a bit unlucky right now. But there's also this irony to it. Like, they're kind of poking fun at themselves at the whole doom and gloom. </li>
        <li>Yeah, and that's what I find so fascinating about this one, especially within the whole world of zines. Zines are all about challenging norms, expressing what people are afraid to say. Yeah. Here they're even critiquing themselves a little bit, like the potential negativity in their own community. </li>
        <li>Interesting.</li>
        <li>They call out that whole cultural subservient nine to five grind, the way everybody has opinions, but nobody really believes anything. Like they're saying, look, let's be real. Even angst can become routine. </li>
        <li>Wow, yeah, that's a really good point. </li>
        <li>And then they even reference their earlier work, &quot;A Historia do Barquinho&quot;. It's like an inside joke for their longtime readers, you know? </li>
        <li>I see.</li>
        <li>A little nod to how they've evolved. </li>
        <li>So they're self-aware. </li>
        <li>Yeah, very much so. But then the tone shifts a bit. It becomes almost apologetic.  There's this line that really stood out to me. &quot;Se somos muito aggro, é porque somos bué-da-emo&quot;. Which means if we are very agro, it's because we're very emo. And that kind of confession nestled in this edgy exterior is actually really powerful. </li>
        <li>Yeah, it's true. It's like this rawness that makes these zines so captivating. Because it's not just about the pandemic. It's about using this moment, the shared experience of global uncertainty, to tap into something much deeper. Something universally human. </li>
        <li>Absolutely. And the index, which is more like a timeline, really, spanning from March to September 2020, gives you these little glimpses into how those feelings kind of evolve over time.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Wow. It's like they're chronicling their own anxieties, right? Like against the backdrop of this global event. </li>
        <li>Totally. And this is where things get really interesting. So instead of just listing out the articles, the index, it's more like a series of snapshots, you know? Capturing that feeling of the time. </li>
        <li>Yeah, you know, speaking of snapshots, some of these titles are so intriguing. </li>
        <li>Yeah, like what, for example? Like &quot;Irritando Merceeiros&quot;. OK. Which translates to irritating shopkeepers. Like what's that about? </li>
        <li>I don't know, is everyone just on edge back then or something? </li>
        <li>Maybe it was just like, you know, lockdowns, restrictions. That constant sense of unease. And then suddenly those little things, those mundane interactions, like going to the shop, become really loaded. Like you're surrounded by it, you know? </li>
        <li>Like the pandemic amplified all those little frustrations, those little annoyances that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  And then. There's &quot;Conversas Modelo&quot;. Model Conversations. It makes me think of those early pandemic days when everybody was suddenly like an expert on epidemiology. </li>
        <li>Oh, totally. Like armchair epidemiologists. Everybody had a theory. </li>
        <li>So do you think that's like satirical then? </li>
        <li>I think so, yeah. </li>
        <li>Like poking fun at the way people were talking about it? </li>
        <li>Yeah, like all the buzzwords and stuff, right? Was it genuine concern or were they just like following the script of the moment? </li>
        <li>Right. Like they're holding up a mirror to society and they're like, Is this really how we react to these major events? </li>
        <li>Yeah. Are we even thinking for ourselves? Or are we just kind of like parrots? </li>
        <li>And how we communicate and connect with each other in the midst of all this chaos, you know? </li>
        <li>For sure. And then we have &quot;Fascismo não empregável&quot;. Which is unusable fascism. And that one, that one feels really loaded.</li>
        <li>Especially given like the political climate of 2020, both in Portugal and globally. So what is he trying to say with that phrase? </li>
        <li>That's the question, isn't it?</li>
        <li>It's provocative. It's meant to spark a reaction. </li>
        <li>And that's what zines do well, right? Challenge you a little bit, make you think. </li>
        <li>Push the boundaries. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And you know what else I noticed? What? All these titles, they have page numbers next to them. So it's not just writing. Right. There's visuals, too.</li>
        <li>Oh, so it's like a multi-layered experience. Exactly. You have to decipher the text, the visuals, the emotions. </li>
        <li>Yeah, it's meant to be experienced. </li>
        <li>It's interactive. </li>
        <li>Yeah, you're not just passively consuming this. You're supposed to think about it.</li>
        <li>Yeah, and it's so refreshing, you know? </li>
        <li>In what way? </li>
        <li>Well, because of the world today, it often feels very surface level. But this zine goes deep. </li>
        <li>Yeah, it's raw. Unfiltered. </li>
        <li>Embracing like the messiness of it all. It's not shying away from the hard stuff. </li>
        <li>It's like they're saying the world might be falling apart, but we're not gonna pretend everything's okay. Yeah, it's about embracing the uncertainty, the vulnerability of being human. </li>
        <li>Especially during crazy times like that. </li>
        <li>Exactly. And there's something really powerful about that. It's about finding that connection even when things are chaotic. And that takes us back to John Donne. It does. &quot;Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind&quot;. </li>
        <li>You know, it's like even with that harsh cynical tone, they're still acknowledging that deep down we're all connected, especially when there's like a shared crisis. And this zine with all its rough edges becomes a testament to that. </li>
        <li>Yeah, it's like they're saying, look, we might be isolated physically, emotionally even, but we're all going through this thing called life together. And that shared experience as challenging as it can be, it matters. </li>
        <li>It does, and this is why I think engaging with primary sources like these zines is so important. It's not just about looking back at the past. It's about understanding what it means to be human through a different lens, you know? </li>
        <li>Raw and unfiltered. Like appreciating the different viewpoints, even if they make us uncomfortable.</li>
        <li>Exactly, and who knows, maybe this will spark something in you. Maybe you'll go out and find zines from your own community. Or different time periods. </li>
        <li>Different cultures. </li>
        <li>Yeah, exactly. </li>
        <li>Maybe even create your own. </li>
        <li>There you go. </li>
        <li>Because zines are more than just photocopied pages. They're about that human connection, you know. Finding your voice and sharing it. So go out there, dive in. </li>
        <li>You never know what you might find. </li>
        <li>That's right. </li>
        <li>Thanks for joining us on this deep dive into &quot;You lucky bastard, hashtag&quot;. </li>
        <li>Yeah, this was great.</li>
