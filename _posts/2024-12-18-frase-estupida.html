    <p>Diz-se que disse seriamente <b>David Graeber</b>, antropólogo, numa peça que contradiz, diz-que-disse ironicamente como alerta às neuras do povo à esquerda. Numa semana que muitos comentam um <b>Luigi Nicholas Mangione</b> de inclinações políticas tão cinzentas que ninguém o pode pintar de vermelho à-lá <b>Baader-Meinhof</b>, trazemos à vossa reflexão a combinação de violência e criatividade. Retalhado, de fazer o mundo à imagem da nossa imaginação:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>This sentence is often attributed to Graeber in the press. And it is true that he did write these words. But he did so as an anthropologist attempting to elucidate an underlying principle of the left, not as an activist promoting a position he seriously held.<br>

    <p>Encontrando o original no <b><i>&quot;Direct Action: An Ethnography&quot;</i></b> <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-direct-action" target="_blank"><sup>(2009)</sup></a> expande-se do sentido que <b>DG</b> daria à frase. Porque temos afazeres natalícios e não aqueles a dever ao consumo, oh oh oh, <i>mashup:</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Both left and right share the view that there is some secret, underlying force lying behind all appearances. For the left, it is creativity; for the right, it is destruction. </p>
        <p>Graeber speculates that <span class="voice">[the]</span> view of violence underlies right-wing politics in general. The right believes that leftists “systematically neglect the social and historical importance of the ‘means of destruction’: states, armies, executioners, barbarian invasions, criminals, destructive mobs, and so on”. <span class="voice">[On the left]</span>, they held to “political ontologies of the imagination”, <span class="voice">[que]</span> views work as the source of value and a creative force springing from the human capacity for imagination.</p>
        <p> This idea, outlandish at first, grew in popularity, such that today it is an assumption uniting different branches of the left. So when Graeber writes that “the ultimate hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently”, he is poking gentle fun at the left. Reality does not spring from our imaginations.</p>
        <p> <b>Assuming you create your own reality is a form of stupidity shared by both left and right, but in different ways.</b><small>in <a href="https://theconversation.com/david-graeber-argued-against-great-man-approaches-to-knowledge-but-it-seems-his-fate-to-become-one-243594" target="_blank"><i>&quot;David Graeber argued against ‘Great Man’ approaches to knowledge, but it seems his fate to become one&quot;</i></a> <sup>17 dez 2024</sup></small></p>

        <p><small><i>&quot;Graeber defines stupidity as failing or refusing to engage in the interpretive labour needed to understand the perspectives of those less powerful than yourself.&quot;</i> <b>OS POSITIVOS</b>: banhamos-nos no labor interpretativo dos pobrezinhos.</small></p>

    <p>Daqui a peça toca direita e esquerda em partes iguais que a nossa má vontade nos impõe repetir, <i>segway</i> ao par académico-religioso do <a href="{{ site.url }}/2024/12/sessao-dupla.html">último filme</a> que vos trouxemos neste espaço.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Violence requires no interpretive labour to achieve its ends. Violence defines a situation by radically simplifying it. In the liberal “church” of the modern university, meanwhile, theory achieves a similar sort of thing. Theory is a simplification of an incredibly complex reality. Theoreticians embraced on the left <span class="voice">[...]</span> believe <b>simply thinking about the world differently is a way to change it</b>. That is, they believe “reality can be brought about by convincing other people it is there”. This is a position strikingly similar to the right, except “the left versions ignore money and force of arms, the exact parts that the right make their centrepieces”. Both left and right elites, according to Graeber, indulge in stupidities only available to the powerful.<br>

    <p>É poderosa a estupidez senhores. Exemplo: os dizeres do <b>DG</b>, que são <i>&quot;easy to find on anarchist websites&quot;</i> mas muitos de vocês irão preferir <i>&quot;buy an edited edition which will gather dust on your shelf&quot;</i> nesta quadra — e lamentamos se repetimos os nossos eternos diatribes, tudo nos são pregos quando estamos de martelo na mão.</p>

    <p> O nosso ponto? Duas pancadas. Primeiro, não é o objecto, são as ideias nesse, <i>&quot;read them, then email them to your friends. Keep the discussion going&quot;.</i> Segundo, a realidade não se muda só com ideias, são precisos os martelos.</p>
