            ♪ Last night, <br> when I walked into your house, I noticed that the couch had moved ♪<br>
            ♪ And I wanted to ask you about it ♪<br>
            ♪ But you were talking, so when you finished, I opened up my mouth ♪<br>
            ♪ And you called me out for being bad at listening ♪<br><br>

            ♪ So I wrote a list of all the things you told me last night ♪<br>
            ♪ Like that yellow is your favorite because it's a happy color ♪<br>
            ♪ And that you have been sad for as long as you remember ♪<br>
            ♪ And that the way your kitchen looked made you upset ♪<br>
            ♪ Because it was a mess, and well, that's the way things look when you're depressed ♪<br>
            ♪ And you sat across the room on that rocking chair you said you hate ♪<br>
            ♪ Cause it is so loud, and I wished that you had sat next to me on the couch ♪<br><br>

            ♪ Like how you said, with tears in your eyes, that you wish that being grateful was enough to keep you from feelin' sad all the time ♪<br>
            ♪ And that your favorite flowers are impatiens ♪<br>
            ♪ And that when you love somebody you wait patiently for them ♪<br>
            ♪ And how you make poor decisions with the people that you choose to date ♪<br><br>

            ♪ And you'll probably think I'm crazy for this ♪<br>
            ♪ I just really, desperately want to be your next poor decision ♪</i>
