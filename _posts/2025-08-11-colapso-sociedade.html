    <blockquote>
        <p><b>History is best told as a story of organised crime.</b> It is one group creating a monopoly on resources through the use of violence over a certain territory and population.</p>
        <p>When you look at the near east, China, Mesoamerica or the Andes, where the first kingdoms and empires arose, you don’t see civilised conduct, you see war, patriarchy and human sacrifice. This was a form of evolutionary backsliding from the egalitarian and mobile hunter-gatherer societies which shared tools and culture widely and survived for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
        <p>All Goliaths, however, contain the seeds of their own demise. They are cursed and this is because of inequality. <span class="voice">[...]</span> Inequality does not arise because all people are greedy. Instead, <span class="voice">[...]</span> as elites extract more wealth from the people and the land, they make societies more fragile, leading to infighting, corruption, immiseration of the masses, less healthy people, overexpansion, environmental degradation and poor decision making by a small oligarchy. The hollowed-out shell of a society is eventually cracked asunder by shocks such as disease, war or climate change.<br>

    <blockquote>
        <p> Collapses in the past were at a regional level and often beneficial for most people, but collapse today would be global and disastrous for all. <span class="voice">[...]</span> Today’s global civilisation is deeply interconnected and unequal and could lead to the worst societal collapse yet.<br>

    <p>Senhores, acima todo o nosso programa resumido num só parágrafo. Todos estes dizeres são mais do mesmo que vos trazemos semana sim, semana sim, são também argumentos com história a substanciar que vos deveriam convencer da máxima do mínimo dos mínimos:</p>
