    <p>Voltamos ao <b>TCJ</b> para entrevista a <b>Johnny Damm</b>, talvez nos antípodas da incursão <a href="{{ site.url }}/2025/09/bd-de-cegos.html">anterior</a> com <b>Ilan Manouach</b> mas continuando de estigmas. Antes academês, agora educativo:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>I think I make educational comics.</b> Despite having a fairly minimal word count, my comics go in-depth on a subject that I think is worth learning about. <br>

    <p>Voltámos às definições, é BD quando o leem, e então o seu encanto:</p>

    <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> Comics are the perfect medium for challenging material — for disturbing histories, for unsettling ideas.</div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>We’ve been conditioned to find reading comics as easy and weirdly, this is despite the fact that comics are enormously complex formally. I think that’s a real power of the medium. <span class="voice">[...]</span> Comics unlock a different part of the reader’s brain than academic writing does. So, comics are a perfect medium for commentary and argument. Comics are a perfect medium for politics. Comics are a perfect medium for hard, challenging ideas. So, please, <b>let’s use comics that way</b>.<br>

    <p>Como Manouach há sampling de materiais <i>("making new comics out of old comics brings comic book history into it. Collage comics have a distinct way of interrogating and playing with our associations with that history and with the medium itself"),</i> desta com maior margem a declarar autoria que caso anterior <i>("my hand is unmissable on the page" + "these choices also make an argument").</i> Também contra esse, maior pertinência na mensagem, não se interroga de como a banda desenhada pode ser desmontada, desmonta-se o mundo pela banda desenhada:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>- What do you make of technocrats increasing interest in cultural issues?<br>
            - Culture is yet another area in which they can create wealth-hoarding monopolies. <b>But another factor is that technocrats appear increasingly comfortable with manipulating societal structures,</b> <strong>this is about social control</strong>. <span class="voice">[...]</span> Big Tech is currently burrowing its way into every aspect of our national infrastructure (education, healthcare, policing, military, etc.) and our lives. So, it feels crucial that we understand their plans for us. At our moment, there are so many horrors to fight against, but it strikes me that Big Tech is a central link connecting them.<br>

    <p>Então por favor contrariem, cabe-nos sabotar estruturas. Se necessário convencer ainda à transição do arsty à propaganda os punx da geração digital que nunca tiveram a oportunidade de sujar as mãos em montagens literais <i>("zines have long been used for grassroots educational purposes")</i>, asseguramos-vos que podem ter ambos,</p>
