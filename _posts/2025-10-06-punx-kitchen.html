    <p>Pacientem-nos mais esta pequena incursão ao passado, ele nunca está muito longe do presente e do daqui para a frente. Memoremos,</p>

    <p>Há treze anos atrás participámos de zine alheio a convite de Hugo R., ex-vocalista de conhecida banda crust. Pediram-nos bd, enviámos-lhe fan art de putos norte-américas a tocar folk acústico como se punk amplificado.

        Apesar do mixtape no claim e diferentes refrões que se podem ouvir pelas aventuras dos nossos amiguinhos, demorámos outros treze a explicitar nas nossas páginas letras de terceiros, e o <i><b>"Punks With Clean Kitchens"</b></i> já <a href="{{ site.url }}/2025/09/past-past.html">recordado</a> foi a primeira referência musical alguma vez destacada, ainda hoje banda sonora quintessencial d<b>OS POSITIVOS</b> tantos anos depois.

        Os putos já não o são, o Evan é @ Evan, a outros cresceu-lhes barba, parece que um se fez advogado, outro chegámos a ouvir em bar/garagem por LX <sup class="asterisk">(*)</sup> <span class="sidenote sidenote-right">Concerto-café assistido com o Skin dos Lifeblind: dois calmeirões de metro e noventa entroncados cabelo rapado que destoavam dos nativos. Final da actuação o Ryan H. cumprimenta-me cordial-desconfiado e apanha-me desprevenido: <i>"what's your name?..."</i> <strong>Aprendemos a ter resposta pronta.</strong></span> nas suas andanças a pregar a revolução, todos se espalharam ao vento e o sítio do Riot-Folk! Collective desaparido da internet.</p>

    <p> Culpados da mesma limpeza de arquivos — foi dos primeiros comix que <a href="{{ site.url }}/2012/07/4ever.html">apagámos</a> da nossa linha do tempo na mais recente revisão — fazemos-lhes justiça repetindo letra na totalidade. Quem não o souber cantarolar, leia-o poema-instrutório, talvez um <i>"Waste Land"</i> do T.S. Eliot, outra geração, outro mundo, mais optimista porque os teens eram jovens. Façam caso, senhores,</p>
