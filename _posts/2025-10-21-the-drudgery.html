<h2 class="subtitle">« it's actually a choice »</h2>
<div class="coluna">

    <blockquote>
        <p>Technology companies present this as natural and inevitable when it's actually a choice about how we organize economic relations. The future appears as something that happens to us rather than something we collectively choose. <span class="voice">[...]</span> Until we can envision and construct other paths to dominant technological advancement, we will continue to perceive innovation as a form of oppression rather than emancipation.<br>

    <p>Voltaremos a apontar aos <a href="{{ site.url }}/2025/10/justificado-anti.html">cómicos</a> — quando não? quiçá um dia os imaginem inovação —, hoje continuamos contexto retalhando uma de muitas leituras do <i><a href="https://collectivefutures.blog/about/" target="_blank"><b>"Our Collective Futures"</b></a>,</i> blog que <i>"draws heavily on critical theory, particularly work of people like <b>David Graeber</b>, <b>Mark Fisher</b>, and <b>Jacques Derrida</b>, to analyze the current state of business-as-usual",</i></p>


    <blockquote>
        <p>AI exists to make your job obsolete because the alternative is that AI makes managers obsolete. Let me try to break down this theory.</p>

        <p>Artificial intelligence could easily replace most management functions.
            What managers actually do? They aggregate information from multiple sources, identify patterns, make decisions based on those patterns, and communicate those decisions to others. Every one of these activities falls squarely within the capabilities of current AI systems.

        <p>But this will never happen because those deploying the technology are the managers themselves. They're not going to automate their own positions out of existence. Instead, they'll use AI to intensify surveillance of workers, automate the creative and meaningful aspects of work, and concentrate decision-making power even further up the hierarchy.

        <p>Managers will continue to target workers' jobs precisely because the alternative, eliminating management, would redistribute power downward rather than concentrating it upward.

        <p>Workers are right to be worried, but not for the reasons they think. They're not being replaced by superior intelligence. <b>They're being systematically deskilled and made dependent on systems they don't fully shape</b>, controlled by people who view them as obstacles to profit maximization.

        <p>The people who control the machines have been coming for our jobs throughout history. It's just now that they're using artificial intelligence as a cover for the same old redistribution of wealth and power from workers to owners.<br>

    <p>Já vos trouxemos no que parece um passado distante (anteriores à IA...) notas de <a href="{{ site.url }}/2016/12/pobres-ricos-pobres-ricos.html">David Graeber</a> & <a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/08/realismo-capitalista-1.html">Mark Fisher</a> destes paradoxos peculiares do capitalismo, porém nunca demais renová-los:</p>

    <div class="blurb"><i class="bubble"></i> actual productive work becomes harder to accomplish</div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Despite centuries of technological progress promising to liberate us from drudgery, we have instead created vast bureaucratic structures filled with jobs that serve no social purpose. The people performing these jobs know their roles are meaningless. They spend their days shuffling papers, attending meetings about meetings, performing elaborate rituals of productivity while producing nothing of value.</p>

        <p>Artificial intelligence arrived with the promise to finally solve the drudgery. Instead, everything got spectacularly worse.</p>

        <p>The current AI deployment is creating new categories of human work that are even more meaningless than the original bullshit jobs Graeber documented. We now have entire professions dedicated to "prompt engineering": each of these roles generates its own bureaucratic apparatus of reports, meetings, standards, and compliance procedures that no one will ever read [consuming] enormous amounts of human effort, energy, and planetary resources.<br>
