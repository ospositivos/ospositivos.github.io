        <p>The systems meant to mediate our understanding of reality have always been extractive, manipulative, and oriented toward the production of subjects amenable to control. The difference now is that the mechanisms have become so totalizing that the illusion of neutrality has finally collapsed under its own algorithmic bias.</p>
        <p>Can critical <del>design</del> <ins>punk</ins> function more than just commentary? Can it serve as a means of rebuilding the conditions that <b>enable meaningful learning, critical thinking, and collective action</b> in an environment designed to prevent all three?

    <p>Uma pela propaganda, a boa, a nossa. Assumimos quando muitos ainda a desdenham, como abraçámos o populismo para o outro lado quando cabecinhas bem-pensantes o denegriam por crónicas aflitivas de institucionalismo crónico-decadente mero par de anos atrás (e agora já recomendam com urgência infligida, meh). Apropriamos texto alheio alterando de <b>"design"</b> para <b>"punk"</b> porque bom design cumpre função.</p>

        <p>Definições: <i>"Critical design is often also referred to as discursive design, and it operates as a mode of inquiry that interrogates the assumptions embedded in designed objects and systems. Where commercial design naturalizes existing social relations of business-as-usual and economic logics of growth, critical design makes these relations visible and contestable.</i>

    <blockquote>
        <p>This is a liminal moment as we stand between the collapse of 20th-century sensemaking institutions (the media systems, academic disciplines, and democratic norms that once provided epistemic orientation) and an unknown configuration that has not yet crystallized. In this threshold, critical <del>design</del> <ins>punk</ins> emerges as a necessary practice for navigating a crisis-ridden information infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Critical <del>design</del> <ins>punk</ins> must operate within this terrain of panic, depression, weaponized information, and incomprehensible hyperobjects. It cannot generate culture in the sense that tech platforms generate products and services. Culture emerges from friction between existing power structures and practices that resist them. So critical <del>design</del> <ins>punk</ins> provides cultural cartography: <b>mapping the terrain of our current regime while sketching the new pathways</b> where alternative (and preferable) futures might become possible.<br>

    <p>E do punk no discurso? Porque, e parem-nos se já ouviram esta antes, sem essa má vontade é só arte.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Of course, <del>critical</del> <ins>art</ins> design cannot be an all-fitting mechanism, and currently, we can say that it is mostly confined in its institutional context. Gallery exhibitions and academic publications reach narrow audiences, which of course, are already sympathetic to critique. This is a problem by itself since <del>critical</del> <ins>art</ins> design should break and create discourse more openly. The challenge becomes for <del>critical</del> <ins>art</ins> design to achieve cultural relevance beyond designated spaces. The answer may lie in prefigurative prototyping (working alternatives despite structural constraints): creating working systems that people can interface with, inhabit, and learn from.<br>

    <p>Uma paralisia mil vezes aqui apontada. Os nossos artsy sofrem de uma incapacidade debilitante para <i>"move beyond its institutional bounds into direct engagement with the infrastructures that structure daily life"</i> quando essa estrutura está hoje no telemóvel e não no livro de estante. Quiçá novos designers do corta-e-cola digitais tentem discursos mais abertos, fora das redes extrativa-designadas. Isso seria punk. E se alguém o ler, poderá ser bd. E se for bd, <b><i>"<del>design</del> <ins>bd</ins> that asks questions rather than solves problems. It provokes debate rather than attempts to settle it."</i></b></p>
