    <p>Ficámos do <a href="{{ site.url }}/2025/11/desenhem-ma-atitude.html">colapso</a> das maneiras antigas e desconhecido das novas. Citamos Cory Doctorow in <i>&quot;The enshittification of labor&quot;</i> <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/07/postwar-social-contract/" target="_blank"><sup>7 nov 2025</sup></a> que cita Pavlina Tcherneva in <i>&quot;The Death of the Social Contract and the Enshittification of Jobs&quot;</i> <a href="https://www.levyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wp_1100.pdf" target="_blank"><sup>nov 2025</sup></a> para tendências na aplicação a modelos económicos dos mesmos princípios identificados na <i>big tech: <b>1) bait</b> (lure in users) <b> 2) trap</b> (use that captive audience to attract businesses) <b>3) switch</b> (exploit those groups to extract maximum profit).</i> Dividem-se épocas de capital,

        <i>feudalism </i> →
        <i>merchant capitalism</i> →
        <i>industrial capitalism</i> →
        <i>banker capitalism </i> →
        <i>welfare state capitalism (&quot;golden age&quot;</i> da grande depressão à década de 70) →
        <i>money manager capitalism</i> (Reagan a 2008: resregulação) →
        <i>international money manager capitalism (&quot;in which gigantic, transnational funds capture our economy&quot;)</i>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Welfare state capitalism was the &quot;bait&quot; stage of the enshittification of labor <span class="voice">[...]</span> promising economic security and decent jobs through cooperation between the government, corporations and unions: public subsidies and regulation produced an environment in which (many) workers were able to command a large share of the fruits of their labor, securing both a living wage and old-age surety. </p>

        <p>The switch came from Reagan, with mass-scale deregulation, a hack-and-slash approach to social spending, and the enshrining of a permanently unemployed reserve army of workers whose &quot;job&quot; was fighting inflation (by not having a job).</p>

        <p>The trap is the brutal fact of necessity itself. You cannot survive without a roof over your head, without electricity, without food and without healthcare. <span class="voice">[...]</span> Once corporations capture control of housing, healthcare, and power (privatization of utilities), they can squeeze the people who depend on these things, because there is no competitor. Control over the labor market and capture of the necessaries of life allows companies to squeeze, and so they do. <br>

    <blockquote>
        <p>As with tech enshittification, we are under no obligation to preserve those enshittificatory policies. We can replace them with better ones. <b>Is a political choice, not an economic inevitability.</b>
