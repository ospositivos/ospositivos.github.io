    <p>A justiça arquiva investigação ao primeiro-ministro pelos negócios que fazia de casa, onde cobrava valores superior aos de mercado, a clientes mistério. Nosso mote ao simulacro de democracia com apanhado de comentários de estudiosos dessa forma de governo num curto sumário que convidamos à vossa reflexão.</p>

    <p>Bases: <i>"democracy refers to a system of <del>representative</del> government with free, fair and relatively frequent elections",</i> cujas instituições podem variar mas no seu <i>core</i> possibilitam <i>"realistic opportunities to remove unpopular governments through a non-violent process":</i> </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Political scientists and philosophers will take pains to tell you <b>there are many forms of democracy</b>: deliberation until we reach something close to consensus; random selection of citizens to decide laws; regular plebiscites to approve or veto policies. <span class="voice">[...]</span> All other political systems hold that there are morally salient distinctions between people which mean entire classes, races or genders should have no say in how they are governed, nor means (short of revolution) to overthrow bad governments.<br>

We asked 5 experts"</i></a> <sup>17 dez 2025</sup></small>

    <p>Dito isso, passos de lógica sobre os quais filosofar, sigam-me como se estivéssemos na Ágora de grécia antiga:</p>

    <ul class="lista"><i>
            <li>People have an intrinsic dignity which means they can and should have a say in decisions which affect their lives.</li>
            <li>Supporting democracy means supporting the idea that citizens will have some degree of oversight of the people making laws on their behalf.</li>
            <li>Democracy requires an independent media, willing and supported to fearlessly hold the feet of the powers of money and government to the fires of critical publicity <span class="voice">[para que]</span> public offices remain free from capture by interested lobbies who support policies which so disadvantage so many ordinary people as to make law and governance, in all but name, their own exclusive prerogative.</li>
        </i>
    </ul>

    <p>Ora, senhores. Quando assistem a debates, o jornalista à mesa é árbitro da verdade que desmonta falácias ou é mestre de cerimónias? O político cercado de jornalistas na rua foge-lhes em pânico porque a sua carreira está prestes a acabar sobre saraivada de questões incómodas, ou senta-os em rodinha e usa-os como tempo de antena sem contraditório? Jornalixo é conclusão de observação e análise. Estendam-lhe mesma premissa que define democracia, <i><strong>"accept its built-in flaws and its tendency to decay from within"</strong>,</i> e construam dela. Mais que provável, desconstruam dela.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>A certain level of scepticism toward whoever currently holds temporary power is not a crisis; it’s a safeguard.</b> Sceptical or mistrusting citizens are not democracy’s transgressors, but its canaries in the coal mine – warning us that current democratic institutions need recalibrating – the real question is how well are we listening to the dissatisfied. <b>Those who benefit from the current rules have weak incentives to acknowledge the flaws, let alone rewrite them.</b> Slowing down and asking how our democratic institutions are working in practice can put real limits on those who currently benefit from the status quo.<br>
