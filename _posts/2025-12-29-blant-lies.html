    <p class="smallish"><i>blatant liars are drawing political support around the world<br>
            it seems we collectively have ceased to care about the truth</i></p>

    <p>Leitura apressada entre paragens por feeds acumulados e nenhum vagar por queimar — acreditem-nos, pegar-lhe-íamos fogo —, trazemos-vos mashup descartado de espiritualidades a transcender factos (pun!) e reimaginado do conhecimento que nos temos, autenticidade:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>A truly human life demands not only knowledge of facts about reality, but also a subjective understanding of the world and of one’s place in it.</b> This is because truth deals in facts while meanings deal in interpretations.</p>

        <p>Understanding, unlike knowledge, is a matter of how we look at the world, of our thinking habits and of cultural constructs – chiefly identities, values and institutions. These things fulfil their function of making us feel at home in the world without making any claim to truth.</p>

        <p>The insistence on truth and devaluation of meaning has led to <span class="voice">[...]</span> a sense of alienation – a breaking of social, historical and traditional bonds with each other and with ourselves. This alienation has provided a feeding ground for populists and anti-democrats, who present themselves as a corrective to the crisis of meaning.</p>

        <p>The champions of democratic truth would do well to remember that the world democracy tries to build is a world of meaningful human endeavour, not just dry knowledge and fact-finding.<br>

    <p>Continuaremos esse empreendimento significativo de-e-para o colectivo, mesmo que o tenhamos de alienar de todas as vezes.</p>
