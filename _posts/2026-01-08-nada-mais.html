    <p> Dum primeiro exemplo, a exemplo, <i>"a zine with mostly one-shot, Far Side-style cartoons, some more sequentially-oriented newspaper cartoons, a few political ones, and a couple of inoffensive columns"</i>, entoa-se a dúvida: <i>"is there room for a paper like that in the modern media landscape?"</i> E asserção,</p>

        <p>In our current era of instant gratification, something about the nature of even low-quality newsprint is tactile enough to make for a very different experience than manipulating the interface on a phone.

    <blockquote>
        <p>It’s rare that I see current newspaper comics. There’s no reason to regard most of them. They’re gutted, empty things, their outreach smaller every day. The audience and leverage they had a century ago seem like a dim fantasy now.<br>

    <p>Doce de artigo maior que aqui fazemos pequeno em resumo atalhado do declínio do formato cujos constrangimentos tecnológicos ditaram estilos e com eles as histórias <sup class="asterisk">(*)</sup> <span class="sidenote sidenote-right"><i>"Bold, direct shapes that read well and printed without undue damage"</i> nos <i>"daily papers dashed off on high-speed presses, where dislocated colors or under-inked blacks weren’t heeded by the men who worked the machinery".</i> <br> Xtra: <i>"The South Korean webtoon model, most notably, is designed principally for scrolling on phones, with big weekly updates to often elaborate, grand narratives. A three-panel Garfield joke simply can't be read the same way."</i></span>:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In the first half of the 20th century, comics were a selling point of newspapers. All age groups and social classes read and enjoyed them. Hefty Sunday papers were wrapped in their color comics section; its arrival made a grand thud on doorsteps. Comics made a difference.</p>

        <p>Newspaper comics’ decline began with size reduction during the second World War. With few exceptions, former full-page Sunday strips went to half or third pages, <span class="voice">[...]</span> reduced to fourth, fifth and sixth pages, <span class="voice">[...]</span> chopped and stacked panels and crammed as many features as one page could hold.</p>

        <p>By the 1970s, with the exception of G. B. Trudeau’s Doonesbury, the legacy strips were on life support. Walt Kelly, Roy Crane, Gus Arriola, Al Capp, Milton Caniff and Chester Gould still produced work, but most strips had outlived their creators and were continued by assistants or ghosts. Editors shrank the comics further — perhaps to alienate their audience and provide an excuse to get rid of them.</p>

        <p>By the start of the 1980s, most Sunday comic strips appeared in quarter-page editions; the dailies seldom exceeded one-third of a page’s width. There wasn’t enough real estate for a cartoonist to say or do much. Those who fought for more space, like Bill Watterson and Berke Breathed, gave up over time; it wasn’t a battle worth fighting for them.<br>

    <p>Tempo & espaço. Subtraído o <i>print</i> das paisagens mediáticas modernas, a guerra é a mesma, as audiências potencialmente maiores se conseguirem acertar formato: <i>"Comics, <del>whatever format they're printed in,</del> are only as viable as their connection to their readers.</i></p>

        <i>"The strip’s cast became chess pieces in a well-worn game;<br>
            move one toward another and something will happen. <br>
            The endgame was no longer the long play [...] but a simple situation with a broad payoff<br>
            a quick laugh and nothing more."</i>
