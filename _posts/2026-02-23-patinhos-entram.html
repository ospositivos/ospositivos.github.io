    <p><i>"What happens to the counterculture in the era of instantaneous commodification?"</i> Perguntava <b>Cory Doctorow</b> ao <b>William Gibson</b> em '99. Hoje, poucos dias depois de <a href="{{ site.url }}/2026/02/xpatos-saem.html">compararmos</a> custos ao antigamente, apanhado de várias considerações à vossa atenção, algumas levantadas das de <b>Ryan Broderick</b> afamado dum <i>Garbage Day. Mashup:</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>One anti-commodification measure that's worked reasonably well over the years is to be ugly. Punk zines and early Myspace pages embraced an aesthetic that the existing cohort of trained designers would rather break their fingers than imitate. <span class="voice">[...]</span> There's more than one way to be ugly, of course. The "edgelords" made heavy use of slurs, rape "jokes" and other beyond-the-pale rhetoric. <span class="voice">[This]</span> had the effect of making these subcultures very difficult to commodify. If you and your friends barely utter a single sentence that can be quoted in a mainstream news forum or office email, it's going to be very hard to co-opt you.<br>

    <p>Outros tempos, antes da atenção se tornar coluna de excel e o ofensivo muito lucrativo, <i>"things have changed"</i> e o intervalo entre <i>"cool things"</i> que se tornam <i>trends</i> é agora quase nulo, obséquio redes e algoritmos e infinita reprodução. Nova hipótese então, porque os jovens serão sempre mais ariscos de testar os limites:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>For young people, the only things that have the level of scarcity and danger required to be seen as cool are whatever is unacceptable on those platforms. In other words, anything (and maybe only things) that're blocked or banned are a candidate to be cool. Cool people walk away from the places where you'd expect to find them and hang out in places that are culturally viewed as less important.<br>

        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>This is the source of far-right influencers' influence: the fact that manosphere weirdos and trolls are hanging out in "shadowy corners" makes them feel authentic and outside of the norm and thus intrinsically interesting.<br>

    <p>Que satisfará os normies mas os kiddos verdadeiramente punx navegam outra dimensão mais degenerada ao status quo: o verdadeiro cool não está no deplataformar por banimento, mas no <b>impossível de monetizar</b>. O artigo recupera velhas diatribes ao copyright (como em: já vem de trás, por nenhum esticão da imaginação assunto enterrado), sumarizados aqui num <i>"this means that media that can be accused of infringing copyright is the most unwelcome content on platforms"</i> e destaque que vos deixamos:</p>

    <div class="coluna info">

        <blockquote>
            <p> Nearly all the art and culture that means something to me started as something that was transgressive and weird, and even if it was eventually metabolized by the mainstream, that was only after it had a chance to ferment and mutate in a tide-pool of Bohemian weirdness. <span class="voice">[...]</span> That process has only accelerated the recommodification machine but there's one thing that is harder to co-op – "unmonetizable content," the Kryptonite of the platforms.</p>

            <p>The "coolest" media – the stuff that makes taste – is the stuff that fits in this zone of copyright infringement. As platforms police speech less and less, edgelords lose their sheen, but this material, at or beyond the edge of copyright, unwelcome on platforms, is the future face of cool. <b>The most dangerous thing for platforms is not racist garbage. It’s unmonetizeable content.</b><br>

        <blockquote>
            <p>If everything is just attention now, and attention is completely commodified by algorithmic tech platforms, how can you push back against that? Well, I am slowly coming around to a theory on the new cool: You have to essentially pre-deplatform yourself.<br>

    <p>Exemplo do próprio Cory que dá corpo ao manifesto, no processo recuperando uma expressão que atribui a <b>Bruce Sterling</b>:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I make a lot of "unmonetizable content," starting with this blog, which has no metrics, no analytics, and (of course) no ads. I refuse to add social media cards, and hide obscure jokes in incredibly long URLs that get truncated on social media. I labor for hours over the weird illustrations that go at the top of the post that let pretty much anyone do pretty much anything with them. <span class="voice">[...]</span> I do this to <strong>"woo the muse of the odd"</strong>.<br>

        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p> I don't think you can last by meeting the contemporary public taste, the taste from the last quarterly report. I don't think you can last by following demographics and carefully meeting expectations. I don't know many works of art that last that are condescending. I don't know many works of art that last that are deliberately stupid… Get weird. Get way weird. Get dangerously weird. Get sophisticatedly, thoroughly weird and don't do it halfway, put every ounce of horsepower you have behind it.<br>
